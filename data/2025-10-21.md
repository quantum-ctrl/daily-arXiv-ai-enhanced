Abstract: Pi-conjugated covalent organic frameworks (COFs) provide a versatile platform
for the realization of designer quantum nanomaterials. Strong electron-electron
correlation within these artificial lattices can give rise to exotic phases of
matter. Their experimental realization however requires precise control over
orbital symmetry, charge localization, and band dispersion all arising from the
effective hybridization between molecular linkers and nodes. Here, we present a
modular strategy for constructing diatomic Kagome lattices from
aza-[3]triangulene (A[3]T) nodes, in which a D3h symmetric ground state is
stabilized through resonance contributions from a cumulenenic linker.
First-principles density-functional theory and scanning tunnelling spectroscopy
reveal that the hybridization of a sixfold degenerate set of edge-localized
Wannier functions in the unit cell gives rise to orbital-phase
frustration-induced non-trivial flat bands. These results establish a general
design principle for engineering orbital interactions in organic lattices and
open a pathway toward programmable COF-based quantum materials with correlated
electronic ground states.

Abstract: Encapsulating low-dimensional magnetic materials within carbon nanotubes
(CNTs) offers a compelling route to stabilize unconventional magnetic states
and engineer quantum functionalities at the limit of miniaturization. In this
work, we systematically investigate the structural, electronic, and magnetic
properties of one-dimensional (1D) CrSBr chains encapsulated within CNTs using
density functional theory (DFT) and spin dynamics simulations. We demonstrate
the structural stability of CrSBr@CNT, where confinement and charge transfer
cooperate to stabilize ferromagnetism in the 1D limit, which persists up to 50
K. These findings position CrSBr@CNT as a model platform for realizing 1D
magnetism and establish CNT encapsulation as a powerful strategy for exploring
emergent quantum spin phenomena and engineering nanoscale spintronic devices.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Driven-dissipative systems provide a natural setting for the emergence of
exceptional points -- i.e. non-Hermitian degeneracies where eigenmodes
coalesce. These points are important for applications such as sensing, where
enhanced sensitivity is required, and exhibit interesting and useful phenomena
that can be controlled with experimentally accessible parameters. In this
regard a four-port, three-mode, cavity-magnonics platform is demonstrated in
which two microwave excitations can be precisely phase shifted and/or
attenuated relative to one another. Destructive interference between the
hybridised cavity-magnon modes is shown to give rise to antimodes
(antiresonances) in the transmission spectrum, enabling coherent perfect
extinction of the outgoing signals at selected ports. This interference can be
used to actively tune the position and properties of exceptional points,
without the fine tuning conventionally required to obtain exceptional points.
Such controllable, interference-based engineering of exceptional points
provides a practical and flexible pathway toward next-generation,
high-sensitivity sensing devices operating at microwave frequencies.

Abstract: Small polarons remain a significant bottleneck in the realization of
efficient devices using transition metal oxides. Routes to engineer small
polaron coupling to electronic states and lattice modes to control carrier
localization remain unclear. Here, we measure the formation of small polarons
in CuFeO$_{2}$ using transient extreme ultraviolet reflection spectroscopy and
compare it to theoretical predictions in realistically parameterized Holstein
models, demonstrating that polaron localization depends on its coupling to the
high-frequency versus low-frequency components of the phonon bath. We measure
that small polaron formation occurs on a comparable ~100 fs timescale to other
Fe(III) compounds. After formation, a dynamic delocalization of the small
polaron occurs through a coherent lattice expansion between Fe-O layers and
charge-sharing with surrounding Fe(IV) states. Our simulations of polaron
formation dynamics reveal that two major factors dictate polaron formation
timescales: phonon density and reorganization energy distributions between
acoustic and optical modes, matching experimental findings. Our work provides a
detailed, real-time observation of how electronic-structural coupling in a
polaron-host material can be leveraged to suppress polaronic effects for
various applications.

Abstract: High-resolution absorption and laser spectroscopy are used to determine
electronic energy levels for Ho$^{3+}$ ions in K$_2$YF$_5$ microparticles. A
total of 72 crystal-field energy levels, distributed among 8 multiplets, are
assigned. This optical data is used for crystal-field modelling of the
electronic structure of Ho$^{3+}$ in K$_2$YF$_5$. Partially-resolved hyperfine
splittings are accurately reproduced by the model. The temperature dependence
of the fluorescent lifetime of the $^5$F$_5$ multiplet is measured and the
temperature dependence of the non-radiative relaxation is modelled by a
five-phonon process. Preliminary measurements of infra-red to visible
upconversion in microparticles co-doped with Ho$^{3+}$ and Yb$^{3+}$ is
reported.

Abstract: In density functional theory, the SCAN (Strongly Constrained and
Appropriately Normed) and r2SCAN functionals significantly improve over
generalized gradient approximation functionals such as PBE
(Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof) in predicting electronic, magnetic, and structural
properties across various materials, including transition-metal compounds.
However, there remain puzzling cases where SCAN and r2SCAN underperform, such
as in calculating the band structure of graphene, the magnetic moment of Fe,
the potential energy curve of the Cr2 molecule, and the bond length of VO2.
This research identifies a common characteristic among these challenging
materials: non-compact covalent bonding through s-s, p-p, or d-d electron
hybridization. While SCAN and r2SCAN excel at capturing electron localization
at local atomic sites, they struggle to accurately describe electron
localization in non-compact covalent bonds, resulting in a biased improvement.
To address this issue, we propose the r2SCAN+V approach as a practical
modification that improves accuracy across all the tested materials. The
parameter V is 4 eV for metallic Fe, but substantially lower for the other
cases. Our findings provide valuable insights for the future development of
advanced functionals.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Two-dimensional(2D) multiferroic materials hold significant promise for
advancing the miniaturization and integration of nanodevices. In this study, we
demonstrate that 2D bilayer ScI2, which exhibits ferromagnetic(FM) ordering
within each layer, enables the tuning of interlayer magnetic coupling,
ferroelectricity, and valley polarization through interlayer sliding and
rotation. Our first-principles calculations show that the AA stacking
configuration induces antiferromagnetic (AFM) interlayer coupling, while a 180
rotation of one layer (resulting in the antialigned AA stacking) leads to FM
interlayer coupling. Moreover, the interlayer magnetic coupling can be switched
between AFM and FM by translating the stacking configuration: FM in the aligned
AB and BA configurations, and AFM in the antialigned AB and BA configurations.
This switching behavior is driven by variations in superexchange interactions
due to orbital hopping between layers. Notably, the aligned stacking exhibits
ferroelectricity upon sliding, which is induced by interlayer orbital
hybridization and the resulting asymmetric charge redistribution, with maximal
ferroelectric behavior occurring at the AB and BA stacking configurations.
Additionally, for the AB and BA stackings, spontaneous valley polarization
emerges from the manipulation of the spin orientation toward the out-of-plane
direction. This valley polarization arises due to inversion symmetry breaking,
either through ferroelectricity (in the AB and BA stackings) or AFM interlayer
coupling , in combination with spin-orbit coupling. These results highlight the
intricate interplay between magnetism, ferroelectricity, and valley
polarization in bilayer ScI2, with each property being tunable via stacking
configuration.

Abstract: Thermal decomposition of metastable fcc-(Ti,Al)Nx limits the lifetime of
coated components. While energetic decomposition aspects can be modelled
reliably, the inherent variability of chemical environment-dependent diffusion
activation energies remains systematically unexplored. Here, we predict an
activation energy range (envelope) for mass transport in varying chemical
environments, reflecting the vacancy concentration range fcc-(Ti0.5Al0.5)1-xNx
with x = 0.47, 0.5, 0.53. The stoichiometric compound shows maximum thermal
stability, consistent with experimental data. Metal vacancies decrease the
average migration energy, while metal and nitrogen vacancies reduce barriers
via lattice strain relaxation, enhancing mobility. The strong chemical
environment dependence challenges conclusions from single-point activation
energy data.

Abstract: This study investigates two critical aspects of the gas sensing mechanism in
metal oxide sensors: (1) the conditions that maximize chemisorbed oxygen
concentration as a function of temperature and oxygen partial pressure, and (2)
which surface oxygen species (chemisorbed or lattice-bound) are primarily
responsible for interaction with carbon monoxide (CO). SnO2 thin films,
deposited at temperatures as low as 60 C and exhibiting mixed
amorphous-crystalline phases with open, tortuous porosity, were evaluated for
CO sensing at 200 C. Comprehensive characterization using EIS, MS, XPS, TEM,
and sensor tests revealed a strong correlation between high sensing performance
and the structural/electronic features of the defect rich
low-temperature-deposited SnO2. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)
was employed to identify the optimal sensing temperature. Mass spectroscopy
(MS) used to analyze the exhaust gases after sensing reactions. The films
exhibited oxygen under-stoichiometry and high concentrations of chemisorbed
oxygen species. In situ XPS under 1 mbar (10000 ppm) O2 and CO exposures showed
that chemisorbed oxygen, not lattice oxygen, was actively involved in CO
oxidation, as further confirmed by CO2 detection via Mass spectroscopy (MS).
Quantitative analysis revealed dynamic surface chemical status alternations,
emphasizing the pivotal role of chemisorbed oxygen in the sensing mechanism at
200 C.

Abstract: Two classes of Phase Change Materials (PCMs) have emerged as the best
candidates for applications requiring the fast reading and writing of data:
GeTe-Sb$_{2}$Te$_{3}$ pseudobinary alloys (group 1) and doped Sb-Te compounds
near the eutectic composition Sb$_{70}$Te$_{30}$ (group 2). Both material
classes undergo reversible switching between a low-resistance opaque
crystalline phase and a high-resistance but less absorbing amorphous phase
through heating, electrical, or optical pulses, achieving (sub-)nanosecond
switching speeds. While group 1 compounds are employed in current generation
devices and relatively well studied, model systems in group 2 compounds have
been found to crystallize more rapidly and thus offer the perspective of
improved devices. Despite their superior crystallization speed (SET process),
to this point there have been no ultrafast experimental studies on crystallized
PCMs of group 2 for the RESET process. Here we perform ultrafast electron
diffraction and femtosecond resolved sum frequency non-linear spectroscopy on
Peierls distorted Sb$_{2}$Te crystallized thin films (PCM of group 2) following
femtosecond optical pulse irradiation. We observe a pump-induced structural
change on two distinct timescales: responses with characteristic timescales of
$\approx$ 300 fs and 2~ps. We quantified the experimental result by a coherent
displacement and the Debye-Waller effect. In particular, the $\approx$ 300 fs
UED signal results from the ultrafast release of the Peierls distortion through
non-thermal coherent Sb displacement, while the 2~ps response reflects
electron-lattice equilibrium. These results reveal the ultrafast non-thermal
structural dynamics of Sb$_{2}$Te and suggest energy-efficient switching of
group 2 PCMs should be possible on femtosecond time scales.

Abstract: We introduce UEIPNet, an equivariant graph neural network designed to predict
both interatomic potentials and tight-binding (TB) Hamiltonians for an atomic
structure. The UEIPNet is trained using density functional theory calculations
followed by Wannier projection to predict energies and forces as node-level
targets and Wannier-projected TB matrices as edge-level targets. This enables
physically consistent modeling of coupled mechanical electronic responses with
near-DFT accuracy. Trained on bilayer graphene and monolayer MoS2 DFT data,
UEIPNet captures key deformation-electronic effects: in twisted bilayer
graphene, it reveals how interlayer spacing, in-plane strain, and out-of-plane
corrugation drive isolated flat-band formation, and further shows that
modulating substrate interaction strength can generate flat bands even away
from the magic angle. For monolayer MoS2, the UEIPNet accurately reproduces
phonon dispersions, strain-dependent band-gap evolution, and local density of
states modulations under non-uniform strain. The UEIPNet offers a generalized,
efficient, and scalable framework for studying deformation-electronic coupling
in large-scale atomistic systems, bridging classical atomistic simulations and
electronic-structure calculations.

Abstract: Semiconductor magic-size clusters (MSCs) are atomically precise nanoparticles
exhibiting unique size-dependent properties, but their ultrasmall dimensions
hinder structural characterization, limiting our understanding of their
formation and stability. A few MSC structures have been fully resolved,
revealing either bulk-like zincblende-type structures or a range of
non-bulk-like motifs. Here we use a computational model to investigate the
relationship between cluster size and atomic structure in zincblende-forming
II-VI and III-V semiconductors. Firstly, we find that all non-bulk-like MSCs in
these systems exhibit the same distorted icosahedral motif that is
intrinsically chiral. Secondly, we reproduce these MSC geometries in
small-cluster self-assembly simulations and discover that their chirality
emerges from the geometric frustration and symmetry breaking in arranging
tetrahedral bonding environments into an icosahedral topology. Overall, this
work reproduces experimentally reported motifs without system-specific
parameterization, establishes the structural origin of chirality in MSCs, and
provides design principles for predicting new cluster geometries.

Abstract: We present the results of measurements of bulk current-voltage (I-V)
characteristics and local surface I-V characteristics by atomic force
microscopy (AFM) of iodine-doped PbS films. It is established that bulk I-V
curves of both undoped and iodine-doped PbS films demonstrate a linear (ohmic)
U(I) dependence. The tipe of local surface I-V characteristics is ohmic at the
concentration range of the dopant 0<[NH4I]<=0.10 M and becomes rectifying at
[NH4I]>=0.15 M, which is determined by a decrease in the size and a change in
the shape of the film grains, as well as a decrease in the surface roughness of
the film. An increase in the iodine content in the PbS(I) films leads to
nonlinear dependences of the microscopic characteristics and photoelectric
parameters of the PbS(I) films. A sharp decrease in the diffusion coefficient,
the beginning of an increase in the charge carrier lifetime, a maximum in
voltage sensitivity and specific detectability are observed in the PbS(I) film
chemically deposited from a reaction mixture containing [NH4I] = 0.15 M. This
indicates that the optimalconcentration of iodine in the film is 2.7 at.%.

Abstract: Tandem solar cells offer a promising alternative to exceed the efficiency
limits of single-junction silicon photovoltaics, yet they require
high-performance recombination junctions that are transparent, passivating, and
electrically efficient. Indium tin oxide (ITO), which is conventionally used as
a recombination junction material, faces challenges related to indium scarcity
and sputter-induced damage. This work investigates hydrogenated aluminum-doped
zinc oxide (AZO:H) deposited by spatial atomic layer deposition (s-ALD) as a
viable indiumfree alternative for TOPCon-based bottom cells. The deposited
AZO:H films demonstrate excellent transparency, exceeding 90% in the 380-1200
nm wavelength range. When applied to n-TOPCon surfaces with an AlOx capping
layer, the stack achieves an outstanding passivation quality, indicated by
implied open-circuit voltage (iVoc) values up to 734 mV after annealing. The
AlOx capping layer proved crucial for enhancing thermal stability by preventing
hydrogen effusion at higher temperatures. While the contact resistivity was
high for the 20 nm thick films tested, the combination of superior optical and
passivation properties establishes spatial ALD-deposited AZO:H as a highly
promising material for creating efficient and indiumfree recombination
junctions in next-generation tandem solar cells.

Abstract: Proposing new ways to organize carbon in 2D nanomaterials has been a relevant
strategy in the search for systems with targeted properties for different
applications. One focus is the study of fully sp$^2$ non-graphitic networks,
with successfully synthesized examples. Hybrid sp-sp$^2$ systems of the
graphyne family are a related approach, and many systems have the honeycomb
lattice as a base model. However, other examples have been inspired by other
lattices as the recently proposed r$\gamma$GY sheet, which features a
semiconducting behavior with highly localized \emph{quasi}-1D states. Here, we
investigate how to tune r$\gamma$GY properties by folding this sheet into
nanotube forms. We elucidate mechanisms that determine their electronic
structure by means of density functional theory calculations, as well as we
identify the interplay involving chirality, diameter, and the emergence of
dispersive/localized frontier states on gap modulation through simple
extrapolated methods.

Abstract: Multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs) exhibit exceptional properties but
face significant challenges in developing accurate machine-learning potentials
(MLPs) due to their vast compositional and configurational complexity. Here, we
introduce an efficient small-cell sampling (SCS) method, which allows for
generating diverse and representative training datasets for MPEAs using only
small-cell structures with just one and two elements, thereby bypassing the
computational overhead of iterative active learning cycles and large-cell
density functional theory calculations. The efficacy of the method is carefully
validated through principal component analysis, extrapolation grades
evaluation, and root-mean-square errors and physical properties assessment on
the TiZrHfCuNi system. Further demonstrations on TiZrVMo, CoCrFeMnNi, and
AlTiZrNbHfTa systems accurately reproduce complex phenomena including phase
transitions, chemical orderings, and thermodynamic properties. This work
establishes an efficient one-shot protocol for constructing high-quality
training datasets across multiple elements, laying a solid foundation for
developing universal MLPs for MPEAs.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Multiferroics, which combine ferroelectric and magnetic order, offer a
transformative platform for next-generation electronic devices. However, the
intrinsic competition between the mechanisms driving ferroelectricity and
magnetism in single-phase materials severely limits their performance,
typically resulting in weak magnetoelectric coupling at room temperature. Here,
we propose a solution to this long-standing challenge through the novel concept
of fractional quantum multiferroics (FQMF), where strong magnetoelectric
coupling is naturally realized by coupling fractional quantum ferroelectricity
(FQFE) with altermagnetism (AM). Symmetry analysis shows that reversing the
FQFE polarization necessarily inverts the AM spin splitting under parity-time
($\mathcal{PT}$) or time-reversal ($\mathcal{T}\tau$) operations. A minimal
tight-binding model reproduces this effect, demonstrating electrically driven
spin control without rotating the N\'eel vector. First-principles calculations
further identify a broad family of candidate materials in two and three
dimensions including bulk MnTe, Cr$_2$S$_3$, Mn$_4$Bi$_3$NO$_{15}$ and
two-dimensional AB$_2$ bilayers such as MnX$_2$ (X=Cl, Br, I), CoCl$_2$,
CoBr$_2$, and FeI$_2$. Notably, MnTe exhibits a high N\'eel temperature
($\sim$300 K) and a large electrically switchable spin splitting ($\sim$0.8
eV), demonstrating room-temperature magnetoelectric performance that surpasses
that of conventional multiferroics. To further showcase the technological
potential, we propose an electric-field-controlled FQMF tunnel junction based
on MnTe that achieves tunneling magnetoresistance exceeding 300\%. This work
establishes FQMF as a distinct and promising route to achieving
room-temperature strong magnetoelectric coupling, opening a new avenue for
voltage-controlled spintronics.

electronic, magnetic, and optical behavior of the host. Pristine Ca2SnO4 is a
mechanically stable, wide band gap insulator with mostly ionic covalent bonding
and diamagnetic character. Replacing Ca2+ with Tm3+ introduces several key
changes: (i) localized Tm 4f states create intermediate levels inside the wide
gap, reducing the optical band gap; (ii) exchange and spin orbit interactions
generate strong local magnetic moments and spin asymmetry near the conduction
band; (iii) electron localization function analysis shows enhanced covalency
and electron pockets that stabilize luminescent centers; and (iv) the optical
response shows visible range absorption, refractive index features, and low
energy plasmon peaks while maintaining high energy dielectric stability. These
effects make Tm doped Ca2SnO4 a mechanically robust, optically tunable, and
magnetically active oxide phosphor suitable for red emission, intermediate band
photovoltaics, and spin photon coupling. More broadly, our results show how
targeted rare earth substitution can enable multifunctionality in wide gap
stannates and guide the design of next generation spintronic photonic oxides.

Abstract: A comprehensive analysis is presented for the diffusivity of oxygen defects
and oxygen self-diffusion in ThO$-2$. The migration energy and diffusivity of
oxygen defects with nominal charges have been investigated using density
functional theory and phonon simulations. The pathway for the lowest migration
energy barrier of oxygen vacancies was found to be along the $\langle 100
\rangle$ direction. Neutral and non-neutral oxygen interstitials exhibited
direct (interstitial) and indirect (interstitialcy) migration, respectively.
The vacancy migration barrier was found to be lowest for the highest charge,
while for interstitials, it is lowest when the charge is lowest. The attempt
frequencies of defects were calculated using the Eyring and Vineyard theories.
These frequencies displayed a similar dependence on the defect charge as the
activation barriers. The charge-averaged diffusivity of vacancies and
interstitials were also computed. Across all temperatures, the average vacancy
diffusivity was found to be greater than that of interstitial, indicating that
oxygen vacancies are more mobile than interstitials. Oxygen self- and chemical
diffusion coefficients were analyzed by combining the defect diffusivities with
the concentrations computed using an equilibrium defect thermodynamics. The
self-diffusion coefficient of oxygen was found to rise with temperatures and
lower oxygen pressures. The contributions of various defects to self-diffusion
of oxygen were subsequently examined. In the normal to high oxygen pressure
range, at all temperatures, it is found that interstitials contribute most to
oxygen diffusion in ThO2. At low oxygen pressures, vacancies with highest
charge state were found to dominate oxygen diffusion. The chemical diffusion
coefficient of oxygen was further computed, which was found to increase with
temperature and decrease with hypo-stoichiometry in ThO2 to a plateau value.

Abstract: The crystal lattice governs the emergent electronic, magnetic, and optical
properties of quantum materials, making structural tuning through strain,
pressure, or chemical substitution a key approach for discovering and
controlling novel quantum phases. Beyond static modifications, driving specific
lattice modes with ultrafast stimuli offers a dynamic route for tailoring
material properties out of equilibrium. However, achieving dynamic coherent
control of the nonequilibrium phases via resonant excitation of lattice
coherences remains largely unexplored. Such manipulation enables non-volatile,
on demand amplification and suppression of order parameters on femtosecond
timescales, necessary for next generation optoelectronic ultrafast computation.
In this study, we demonstrate coherent phononic control of a newly discovered,
light-induced metastable magnetization in the van der Waals antiferromagnet
FePS3. By using a sequence of terahertz (THz) pulses, we modulate the
magnetization amplitude at the frequencies of phonon coherences, whose
infrared-active nature and symmetries are further revealed by polarization- and
field-strength-dependent measurements. Furthermore, our two-dimensional THz
spectroscopy, in tandem with first-principles numerical simulations, shows that
these phonons nonlinearly displace a Raman active phonon, which induces the
metastable net magnetization. These findings not only clarify the microscopic
mechanism underlying the metastable state in FePS3 but also establish
vibrational coherences in solids as a powerful tool for ultrafast quantum phase
control, enabling manipulation of material functionalities far from
equilibrium.

Abstract: The Landau-Brazovskii model provides a theoretical framework for describing
various phases arising from competing short- and long-range interactions in
many physical systems. In this work, we investigate phase transitions among
various ordered phases within the three-dimensional Landau-Brazovskii model. We
construct the phase diagram of this model, which encompasses eight distinct
phases, and systematically compute the transition pathways connecting various
metastable and stable states using the Landau-Brazovskii saddle dynamics. Along
each transition pathway, the critical nucleus is identified with some detailed
analyses of its shape, energy barrier, and Hessian eigenvalues. Furthermore, we
explore how the transition state is influenced by model parameters, revealing
systematic trends in critical nucleus sizes and energy barrier heights. Our
results provide a comprehensive characterization of the nucleation mechanisms
within the Landau-Brazovskii model and offer valuable insights into the
structural transformations of modulated-phase systems.

Abstract: We report an interpretation method for deep learning models that allows us to
handle high-dimensional spectral data in materials science. The proposed method
uses feature extraction and clustering analysis to categorize materials into
classes based on similarities in both spectral data and chemical
characteristics such as elemental composition and atomic arrangement. As a
demonstration, we apply this method to an atomistic line graph neural network
(ALIGNN) model trained on first-principles calculation data of 2,681 metal
oxides, chalcogenides, and related compounds for optical absorption spectrum
prediction. Our analysis reveals key elemental species and their coordination
environments that influence optical absorption onset characteristics. The
method proposed herein is broadly applicable to the classification and
interpretation of diverse spectral data, extending beyond the optical
absorption spectra of inorganic crystals.

Abstract: A neuroevolution potential (NEP) for the ternary $\alpha$-Fe--C--H system was
developed based on a database generated from spin-polarized density functional

achieves DFT-level accuracy across a wide range of scenarios commonly

Abstract: In this study, we employ a multi-scale computational modeling approach,
combining density functional theory (DFT) and self-consistent charge density
functional tight binding (SCC-DFTB), to investigate hydrogen (H2) production
and dissociation mechanisms from ammonia (NH3) and methane (CH4) on pristine
and nickel-doped graphene. These two-dimensional materials hold significant
potential for applications in advanced gas sensing and catalysis. Our analysis
reveals that Ni-doped graphene, validated through work function calculations,
is a promising material for gas separation and hydrogen production. The samples
with adsorbed molecules are characterized by calculating chemical potential,
chemical hardness, electronegativity, electrophilicity, vibrational
frequencies, adsorbtion and Gibbs energies by DFT calculations. Methane
molecules preferentially adsorb at the hexagonal ring centers of graphene,
while ammonia inter-acts more strongly with carbon atoms, highlighting distinct
molecular doping mechanisms for CH4 and NH3. Dynamic simulations show that CH4
splits into CH3+H, with Ni-doped graphene facilitating enhanced hydrogen
transmission, while NH3 dissociates into NH2+H, which may lead to N2H4
formation. Our non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) simulations demonstrate
increased H-atom transmission on Ni-doped graphene during gas interactions.
These findings suggest that Ni-doped graphene is superior to pristine graphene
for applications in gas separation, hydrogen production, and high-sensitivity
sensors.

Abstract: This work reports optical and electronic numerical modelling of a novel
emerging structure which is the GaAs nanocrystal on Si tandem solar cell by
epitaxial lateral overgrowth, a technique which allows defect free material
growth. The techniqueconsists of creating nucleation sites in a silicon surface
SiO2 layer and initiating growth of nanoscalescale seeds, whereby strain energy
remains below the Matthews-Blakeslee strain relaxation limit. This leads to
AlxGaAs growth in micro-crystals without generation of material defects. The
focus of this presentation is optical and electrical modelling of nanocrystals
for applications in the very active field of silicon based multijunction solar
cells, and design of a AlxGaAs/Si two terminal tandem, for compositions ranging
from x=0 to x=30% in absorber layers. We present a model of the complete
structure in two dimensions, consisting of a Al xGaAs high bandgap subcell
connected with a tunnel junction to the low bandgap Si junction. The
elaboration of models is described, with an emphasis on the AlxGaAs crystal
featuring a non-planar pn-junction, and a focus on the optical properties of
this lattice of micrometric AlGaAs crystals and in particular their light
trapping properties from the resulting surface texture. The question of AlxGaAs
surface coverage is addressed, given that neighbouring AlxGaAs crystals have
different crystal orientations on a (111) Si surface, such that any coalescence
of neighbour AlxGaAs crystals leads to crippling defects at their interface.
The result is that some high energy incident light above the AlxGaAs bandgap is
nevertheless transmitted directly to the Si cell, such that the resulting
photogenerated carriers thermalise to the Silicon bandgap, and result in a loss
of efficiency. The interface between AlxGaAs and Si subcells is addressed, with
an emphasis on current transport efficiency through the nanoseeds and
tunnelling currents through appropriately designed SiO2 buffer layers. This
work therefore presents a theoretical framework for evaluating the potential of
AlxGaAs nanocrystal growth on Si for light trapping, for GaAs silicon two
terminal tandem cell performance including tunnel junctions, and provides
models and design rules for efficient AlxGaAs microcrystal arrays as high
bandgap subcells for tandem solar cells on silicon.

Abstract: Bond rupture under the action of external forces is induced by temperature
fluctuations. We show that measured forces from single molecule force
spectroscopy experiments can be predicted from two quantities describing the
bond that are the barrier to break the bond in absence of force as well as the
maximal force the bond can withstand. The former can be obtained by a force
free transition state calculation and the latter is determined by a simple
constrained ge- ometry simulates forces (COGEF) calculation. Considering
experimental temperature and force loading rate allows the prediction of
measured bond rupture forces from a closed expression with very good accuracy.

Abstract: Intermetallics often exhibit complex crystal structures, which give rise to
intricate defect structures that critically influence their mechanical and
functional properties. Despite studies on individual defect types, a
comprehensive understanding of the defect landscape in {\mu}-phases, a class of
topologically close-packed phases, remains elusive. In this study, we
investigated the planar defect structures in the Ta-Fe {\mu}-phase across a
compositional range of 46 to 58 at.% Ta using electron microscopy and density
functional theory calculations. Electron backscatter diffraction and
high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy reveal a transition
from basal twin boundaries and planar faults containing C14 TaFe2 Laves phase
layers at a low Ta content to pyramidal {1\bar{1}02} twins at a higher Ta
content. Density functional theory calculations of defect formation energies
confirm a chemical potential-driven stabilisation of Laves phase lamellae. The
prevalence of pyramidal twins in Ta-rich {\mu}-phase samples is attributed to
the competitive nature of different planar defects during solidification. A
defect landscape for {\mu}-phases is proposed, illustrating the interplay
between site occupancy, dislocation types and planar faults across the chemical
potential space. These findings provide fundamental insights into defect
engineering in structurally complex intermetallics and open pathways for
optimising material properties through chemical tuning.

Abstract: Area-selective atomic layer deposition (AS-ALD) is an emerging technology in
semiconductor manufacturing. However, accurately understanding inhibitor
reactivity on surfaces remains challenging, particularly when the substrate is
amorphous. In this study, we employ density functional theory (DFT) to
investigate reaction pathways and quantify the reactivity of
(N,N-dimethylamino)trimethylsilane (DMATMS) and ethyltrichlorosilane (ETS) at
silanol (-OH), siloxane (-O-), amine (-NH2), and imide (-NH-) sites on both
amorphous and crystalline silicon oxide and silicon nitride surfaces. Notably,
both molecules exhibit greater reactivity toward terminal sites (-OH and -NH2)
on amorphous surfaces compared to crystalline counterparts. For bridge sites,
-O- and -NH-, multiple reaction pathways are identified, with bridge-cleavage
reactions being the predominant mechanism, except for DMATMS reactions with
nitride surfaces. The reactivity of DMATMS with -NH- sites is comparable to
that with -NH2, with both reactions yielding volatile products. This study
underscores the importance of amorphous surface modeling in reliably predicting
inhibitor adsorption and reactivity on realistic surfaces. Moreover, we outline
a computational screening approach that accounts for site-specific
precursor-inhibitor interactions, enabling efficient and rational theoretical
design of AS-ALD precursor-inhibitor pairs.

Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures, which combine bi-dimensional materials
of different properties, enable a range of quantum phenomena. Here, we present
a comparative study between the electronic properties of mono- and bi-layer of
platinum diselenide (PtSe2) grown on hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and
graphene substrates using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Using angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT), the
electronic structure of PtSe2/graphene and PtSe2/h-BN vdW heterostructures are
investigated in systematic manner. In contrast to PtSe2/h-BN, the electronic
structure of PtSe2/graphene reveals the presence of interlayer hybridization
between PtSe2 and the graphene, which is evidenced by minigap openings in the
{\pi}-band of graphene. Furthermore, our measurements show that the valence
band maximum (VBM) of monolayer PtSe2 is located at the {\Gamma} point with
different binding energies of about -0.9 eV and -0.55 eV relative to the Fermi
level on h-BN and graphene and substrates, respectively. Our results represent
a significant advance in the understanding of electronic hybridization between
TMDs and different substrates, and they reaffirm the crucial role of the
substrate in any nanoelectronic applications based on van der Waals
heterostructures.

Abstract: Chirality in solids is attracting growing attention as a potential ferroic
order, yet virtually no paradigmatic example of a soft-mode achiral-to-chiral
phase transition has been firmly established to date. Here we identify
ferroelectric bubble domains as a model system that undergoes a strain-driven
achiral-to-chiral transition exhibiting the hallmarks of spontaneous symmetry
breaking. Using second-principles atomistic simulations, we uncover chiral
phonon modes in ferroelectric/dielectric superlattices that soften under
epitaxial strain following textbook soft-mode behaviour. The transition is
accompanied by a change in topological character, highlighting an interplay
between chirality and topology in these systems. This work provides a concrete
step towards establishing chirality as a genuine ferroic order in solids.

Abstract: We investigate the probability of detecting the most nontrivial conductivity
behavior regimes in metals whose electron spectrum is described by the

highly complex electron trajectories on the Fermi surface and correspond to a
nontrivial (scaling) behavior of the conductivity tensor in strong magnetic
fields. The geometry of such trajectories, as well as the corresponding
conductivity regimes, have been well studied theoretically; however, they have
not yet been observed experimentally. The results of our study allow us, in
particular, to estimate the probability of their occurrence and to indicate the
conditions for their possible detection for a wide class of conductors.

regime to fabricate epitaxial CrVO$_3$ superlattice thin films with
atomic-scale accuracy on the periodic arrangement of Cr and V layers. By means
of X-ray diffraction, scanning transmission electron microscopy and Raman

alternating 3, 2 or 1 single atomic layers of Cr$_2$O$_3$ and V$_2$O$_3$. For
the first time, we stabilize the ilmenite phase of CrVO$_3$ (space group R-3)
and compare the functional properties of the thin film with those calculated by
density functional theory. This novel approach to the growth of ordered
corundum oxides opens the path towards the stabilization of new complex oxides

coupling mechanisms in 19 altermagnetic and 4 ferrimagnetic Type-I
multiferroics using electronic band structure calculations with spin-orbit
coupling, a first-principles ME response framework, and spin-space-group theory
analysis. We formulate a universal scheme for realizing nonvolatile ME coupling
in Type-I multiferroics, where two distinct pathways emerge, each dictated by
spin-space symmetry. The first pathway is associated with switching of the spin
splitting or the now familiar spin-momentum locking in reciprocal space,
characteristic of some altermagnetic mul-tiferroics that exhibit coexisting
antiferromagnetism and ferroelectricity. The second pathway involves real-space
magnetization switching via electric polarization reversal, characterized by
switchable components of the linear ME tensor, despite the traditionally weak
coupling in Type-I systems due to the independent origins of magnetism and
ferroelectricity. We demonstrate that these two intrinsic ME coupling
mechanisms are mutually exclusive and propose thermodynami-cally stable
compounds for experimentation. Our findings establish general design principles
for controlling robust nonvolatile ME effects in multiferroic materials.

Abstract: The formation and subsequent growth of structural defects in an irradiated
material can strongly influence the material's performance in technological and
industrial applications. Predicting how the growth of defects affects material
performance is therefore a pressing problem in materials science. One common
computational approach that is used to examine defect growth is cluster
dynamics, a method which employs a system of mean-field rate equations to track
the time evolution of concentrations of individual defect types. However, the
computational complexity of performing cluster dynamics can limit its practical
implementation, specifically in the context of exploring a broad set of
physical conditions corresponding to, for example, different temperatures and
pressures. Here, we present a machine learning approach to circumvent the
computational challenges of performing cluster dynamics while maintaining high
accuracy in the prediction of defect concentrations. The method is illustrated
on the nuclear material uranium nitride but is broadly applicable to other
materials. The developed data-driven method is shown to accurately capture
complex correlations between material properties, temperature, irradiation
conditions, and the concentration of defects.

investigated using piezoresponse force microscopy. Robust and reversible
out-of-plane ferroelectric switching has been observed up to x = 0.35, while
films with x $\geq$ 0.37 exhibit no measurable ferroelectric behavior,
indicating a sharp ferroelectric-to-paraelectric phase transition between x =

LaxBi1-xFeO3 films that retains ferroelectric ordering, highlighting
opportunities to engineer ferroelectric and multiferroic properties in complex

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We examine how an anomalous Josephson current influences odd-frequency
superconducting correlations in two distinct Josephson junction geometries. The
first configuration consists of two ferromagnetic layers sandwiched between
conventional s-wave superconductors, with the magnetization vectors of the
ferromagnets misaligned. The second involves three ferromagnetic layers
embedded between two s-wave superconductors, with their magnetizations oriented
along the x-, y-, and z-axes, respectively. In the first case, where the
anomalous Josephson current is absent, odd-frequency spin-triplet correlations
develop pronounced peaks at finite magnetization strengths in both the
tunneling and transparent limits, while the equal-spin triplet component
exhibits zeros at finite magnetizations in the transparent regime. In the
second configuration, where an anomalous Josephson current is present, similar
peaks in odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing appear at finite magnetizations
under both transport regimes, and the spatial profile of these correlations
remains largely unaffected by the current\rq{}s presence. The Josephson diode
efficiency is finite and attains its maximum at magnetization values
corresponding to the peaks of the anomalous current. Overall, our results
demonstrate that the anomalous Josephson current has only a marginal effect on
odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing, suggesting that the emergence of
odd-frequency correlations and the Josephson diode effect are largely
independent phenomena, contrary to some earlier conjectures.

Abstract: We perform numerically exact determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations of

functions at the imaginary-time midpoint ($\tau=\beta/2$), which suppresses
high-frequency weight and emphasizes low-energy physics. Using this diagnostic,
we identify clear finite-temperature signatures of underlying $d$-wave
superconductivity for electron doping, while finding no clear indication upon
cooling for hole doping. Our analysis enables direct comparison with

Abstract: Time-reversal symmetry-breaking (TRSB) superconductivity has been reported in
a growing number of materials. In some cases, TRSB arises naturally from chiral
superconductivity, but in many low-symmetry systems this explanation is not
viable. In these latter cases, TRSB is often attributed to phase frustration
among multiple superconducting gaps on different Fermi surfaces. Yet, the
microscopic conditions enabling such frustration remain poorly understood.
Here, inspired by the TRSB reported in the superconducting state of iron-based
materials, we demonstrate that a minimal two-orbital model can support a TRSB
superconducting state via phase frustration. We identify the key microscopic
parameters that stabilize TRSB in d-electron systems with orthorhombic symmetry
and provide a framework to systematically enlarge the region of parameter space
within which TRSB is expected in materials with other electronic content and
crystalline symmetries. Our results offer a simple and experimentally relevant
route to understand and control TRSB in multiorbital superconductors.

be caused by open-circuit in multi-phase samples comprised of metals and
insulators by measuring with four-probe method. The evidence strongly suggests
that the reported superconductivity in hydrides should be carefully re-checked.

Abstract: The superconducting diode effect (SDE), characterized by a nonreciprocal
supercurrent, has attracted significant attention in recent years due to its
potential applications. However, most studies have focused on weakly correlated
models, leaving the impact of strong electron-electron interactions on the SDE
largely unexplored. In this work, we bridge this gap by investigating the SDE
in asymmetric band metals with Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) interaction, which are
exactly solvable due to their locality in Bloch momentum space. Through a
combination of low-energy analysis and a numerical self-consistent approach, we
demonstrate that HK interaction can enhance the SDE's quality factor. Our
findings shed light on the role of strong electron-electron correlations in
shaping the SDE.

Abstract: Detection of the Higgs mode in superconductors using nonlinear terahertz
spectroscopy is a key area of interest in condensed matter physics. We
investigate the influence of disorder on the nonlinear terahertz response and
the Higgs mode in NbN thin films with varying Ioffe-Regel parameters ($k_Fl$).
In strongly disordered films near the superconductor-insulator transition
(SIT), we observe an anomalous third-harmonic generation (THG) signal above
$T_c$, which is absent in both cleaner superconducting and non-superconducting
counterparts. The persistence of this normal-state THG signal in a high
magnetic field excludes superconducting fluctuations as its origin. Below
$T_c$, the THG intensity increases sharply, indicating a dominant contribution
from the driven Higgs mode. The THG spectrum of the strongly disordered sample
exhibits a broadened, multi-peak structure, which we attribute to quantum path
interference between distinct channels involving unpaired electrons and Cooper
pairs within emergent superconducting islands. Our findings not only
demonstrate how disorder tunes the nonlinear terahertz response but also
uncover a strong coupling between electrons responsible for normal-state THG
and the superconducting Higgs mode below $T_c$ in strongly disordered samples.

as a uniquely clean and quantifiable platform, we show that a long-range
ordered array emerges as the system spontaneously selects the periodicity that
maximizes its collective light absorption. This establishes a direct,

structural order. Our results thus offer a concrete test for models of
non-equilibrium self-organization.

Abstract: The enhancement and attenuation of near-field radiative heat transfer between

Fluctuational electrodynamics simulations combined with a modal analysis show
that all membranes support corner and edge modes, which can induce a large
5.1-fold enhancement for SiC and a 2.1-fold attenuation for SiO2 of the heat
transfer coefficient with respect to that between infinite surfaces. The
enhancement or attenuation is directly related to material losses which reduce

Abstract: The controlled integration of quantum dots (QDs) as single-photon emitters
into quantum light sources is essential for the implementation of large-scale
quantum networks. In this study, we employ the deterministic in-situ
electron-beam lithography (iEBL) nanotechnology platform to integrate
individual QDs with high accuracy and process yield into circular Bragg grating
(CBG) resonators. Notably, CBG devices comprising just 3 to 4 rings exhibit
photon extraction efficiencies comparable to those of structures with more
rings. This facilitates faster fabrication, reduces the device footprint, and
enables compatibility with electrical contacting. To demonstrate the
scalability of this process, we present results of 95 optically active QD-CBG
devices fabricated across two lithography sessions. These devices exhibit
bright, narrow-linewidth single-photon emission with excellent optical quality.
To evaluate QD placement accuracy, we apply a powerful characterization
technique that combines cathodoluminescence (CL) mapping and scanning electron
microscopy. Statistical analysis of these devices reveals that our iEBL
approach enables high alignment accuracy and a process yield of over >90%
across various CBG geometries. Our findings highlight a reliable route toward
the scalable fabrication of high-performance QD-based single-photon sources for
use in photonic quantum technology applications.

Abstract: We study fermionic and bosonic systems coupled to a real or synthetic static
gauge field that is quantized, so the field itself is a quantum degree of
freedom and can exist in coherent superposition. A natural example is electrons
on a quantum ring encircling a quantized magnetic flux (QMF) generated by a
superconducting current. We show that coupling to a common QMF gives rise to an
emergent interaction between particles with no classical analog, as it is
topological and nonlocal (independent of interparticle distance). Moreover, the
interaction persists even when the particles lie in a nominally field-free
region, with the vector potential mediating the interaction. We analyze several
one- and two-dimensional model systems, encompassing both real and synthetic
gauge fields. These systems exhibit unusual behavior, including strong
nonlinearities, non-integer Chern numbers, and quantum phase transitions.
Furthermore, synthetic gauge fields offer high tunability and can reach field
strengths that are difficult to realize with real magnetic fields, enabling
engineered nonlinearities and interaction profiles.

Abstract: High-quality ultrafast light sources are critical for developing advanced
time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (TrARPES). While the
application of high harmonic generation (HHG) light sources in TrARPES has
increased significantly over the past decade, the optimization of the HHG probe
beam size and selective control of the light polarization, which are important
for TrARPES measurements, have been rarely explored. In this work, we report
the implementation of high-quality HHG probe source with an optimum beam size
down to 57 $\mu$m $\times$ 90 $\mu$m and selective light polarization control,
together with mid-infrared (MIR) pumping source for TrARPES measurements using
a 10 kHz amplifier laser. The selective polarization control of the HHG probe
source allows to enhance bands with different orbital contributions or
symmetries, as demonstrated by experimental data measured on a few
representative transition metal dichalcogenide materials (TMDCs) as well as
topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$. Furthermore, by combining the HHG probe
source with MIR pumping at 2 $\mu$m wavelength, TrARPES on a bilayer graphene
shows a time resolution of 140 fs, allowing to distinguish two different
relaxation processes in graphene. Such high-quality HHG probe source together
with the MIR pumping expands the capability of TrARPES in revealing the
ultrafast dynamics and light-induced emerging phenomena in quantum materials.

Abstract: The MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ material family has emerged as a key platform for
exploring magnetic topological phases, most notably exemplified by the
experimental realization of the axion insulator state. While spin dynamics are
known to significantly influence the axion state, a profound understanding of
their interplay remains elusive. In this work, we employ an antiferromagnetic
spin-chain model to demonstrate that an external magnetic field induces
extrinsic perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. We find that an in-plane field
stabilizes the antiferromagnetic order, whereas an out-of-plane field
destabilizes it and triggers spin-flop transitions. Remarkably, near the
surface spin-flop transition in even-layer MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ films, the axion
insulator state undergoes a sharp switching behavior accompanied by distinct
magnetoelectric responses. Furthermore, we propose that this switchable axionic
magnetoelectric effect can be utilized to convert alternating magnetic field
signals into measurable square-wave magneto-optical outputs, thereby realizing
an axionic analog of a zero-crossing detector. Our findings could open a
pathway toward potential applications of axion insulators in next-generation
spintronic devices.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The primary requirement for achieving spin-selective electron transfer in a
nanojunction possessing a magnetic system with zero net magnetization is to
break the symmetry between the up and down spin sub-Hamiltonians. Circumventing
the available approaches, in the present work, we put forward a new mechanism
for symmetry breaking by introducing a bias drop along the functional element.
To demonstrate this, we consider a magnetic chain with antiparallel alignment
of neighboring magnetic moments. The junction is modeled within a tight-binding
framework, and spin-dependent transmission probabilities are evaluated using
wave-guide theory. The corresponding current components are obtained through
the Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker formalism. Selective spin currents, exhibiting a high
degree of spin polarization, are obtained over a wide bias region. Moreover,
the bias-dependent transmission profile exhibits negative differential
resistance (NDR), another important aspect of our study. We examine the results
under three different potential profiles, one linear and two non-linear, and in
each case, we observe a favorable response. This work may offer a new route for
designing efficient spintronic devices based on bias-controlled magnetic
systems with vanishing net magnetization.

Abstract: The non-equilibrium Green's function method combined with density functional
theory (NEGF-DFT) provides a rigorous framework for simulating nanoscale
electronic transport, but its computational cost scales steeply with system
size. Recent artificial intelligence (AI) approaches have sought to accelerate
such simulations, yet most rely on conventional machine learning, lack atomic
resolution, struggle to extrapolate to larger systems, and cannot predict
multiple properties simultaneously. Here we introduce DeepQT, a deep-learning
framework that integrates graph neural networks with transformer architectures
to enable multi-property predictions of electronic structure and transport
without manual feature engineering. By learning key intermediate quantities of
NEGF-DFT, the equilibrium Hamiltonian and the non-equilibrium total potential
difference, DeepQT reconstructs Hamiltonians under both equilibrium and bias
conditions, yielding accurate transport predictions. Leveraging the principle
of electronic nearsightedness, DeepQT generalizes from small training systems
to much larger ones with high fidelity. Benchmarks on graphene, MoS2, and
silicon diodes with varied defects and dopants show that DeepQT achieves
first-principles accuracy while reducing computational cost by orders of
magnitude. This scalable, transferable framework advances AI-assisted quantum
transport, offering a powerful tool for next-generation nanoelectronic device
design.

Abstract: The celebrated family of the Hall effect plays a fundamental role in modern
physics. Starting from the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) and the quantum AHE
(QAHE) with broken time-reversal symmetry (TRS) to their spinful
generalizations, including spin Hall effect (SHE) and quantum SHE (QSHE)
protected by TRS, they reveal rich transport and topological phenomena.
However, in larger-spin $S$ ($S>1/2$) systems, besides charge current and spin
current, there arise higher-rank spin-tensor currents. Recent work has
uncovered an interesting spin-tensor Hall effect with spin-tensor currents in
these larger-spin systems. Taking a step further, this work discovers a new
class of topological states of matter dubbed \textit{quantum spin-tensor Hall}
(QSTH) insulators with broken TRS, and their nontrivial topology is protected
by a unique \textit{pseudo-TRS}. Most strikingly, QSTH insulators exhibit a
quantized rank-2 spin-tensor Hall conductivity, whereas both charge (rank-0)
and spin (rank-1) conductivities vanish. We also fully characterize their
topological properties and highlight the physical interpretations via the
underlying connections to QSHE. Our work enriches the family of the famous Hall
effects and sheds light on the intriguing topological state of matter in
larger-spin systems. It further offers new avenues toward spin-tensor-tronics
and low-power atomtronics.

Abstract: Flatbands (FB) with compact localized eigenstates (CLS) fall into three main
categories, controlled by the algebraic properties of the CLS set: orthogonal,
linearly independent, linearly dependent (singular). A CLS parametrization
allows us to continuously tune a linearly independent FB into a limiting
orthogonal or a linearly dependent (singular) one. We derive the asymptotic
real space decay of the flat band projectors for each category. The linearly
independent FB is characterized by an exponentially decaying projector and a
corresponding localization length $\xi$, all dressed by an algebraic prefactor.
In the orthogonal limit, the localization length is \(\xi=0\), and the
projector is compact. The singular FB limit corresponds to \(\xi \rightarrow
\infty\) with an emerging power law decay of the projector. We obtain
analytical estimates for the localization length and the algebraic power law
exponents depending on the dimension of the lattice and the number of bands
involved. Numerical results are in excellent agreement with the analytics. Our
results are of relevance for the understanding of the details of the FB quantum
metric discussed in the context of FB superconductivity, the impact of
disorder, and the response to local driving.

Abstract: We present a groundbreaking demonstration of thermal modulation in a
field-effect-controllable semiconductor-superconductor hybrid structure,
wherein the heating mechanism is exclusively radiative. The architecture
comprises two reservoirs separated by $\sim 1$ mm and interconnected via a
completely non-galvanic electrical circuit, enabling the transfer of black-body
radiation from the hot to the cold reservoir. Our device utilizes a
superconducting Josephson field-effect transistor to achieve
magnetic-field-free gate-tunable regulation of heat currents within the
circuit. While prior studies have indicated the potential for electrostatic
modulation of thermal transport properties, our framework demonstrates a
temperature modulation of up to $\sim 45$ mK, exceeding prior findings by more
than an order of magnitude. Furthermore, it proves a thermal transimpedance of
$\sim 20$ mK/V at a bath temperature of $30$ mK. The development of such
systems holds substantial promise for advancing heat management and routing in
quantum chips and radiation sensors, as it enables precise nonlocal control of
heat flow towards a designated structure, even when the heat source is distant

Abstract: We investigate a hybrid device, consisting of two quantum dots proximized by
a BCS superconductor and coupled to two external normal electrodes. Assuming
charge tunneling between quantum dots through the spin-flip processes, we study
the molecular Andreev bound states appearing in the proximized quantum dots. We
show that the spin-orbit coupling induces four quasiparticle states. For the
appropriate set of model parameters, two of these internal quasiparticles
merge, forming the zero-energy state. Under such circumstances, we obtain fully
spin-polarized versions of the Majorana quasiparticles, localized on different
quantum dots. This situation occurs solely when the spin-orbit interaction is
equally strong to the magnitude of crossed Andreev reflections, i.e. in the
sweet spot. Otherwise, these processes are competitive, as indicated in
expectation values of the corresponding order parameters. We analyze signatures
of such competition manifested under the nonequilibrium conditions, for various
configurations of bias voltage. In particular, for the symmetric bias voltage
between the normal electrodes and the Cooper pair splitter bias configuration
we reveal duality in the transport properties. Charge transport through the
zero-energy state at the sweet spot is contributed by perfectly entangled
electrons with an (almost) ideal transmission. Transport studies would thus
enable empirical detection of the molecular quasiparticle states and the
efficiency of dissipation processes caused by the external normal electrodes.

Abstract: Theoretical research has been conducted to study how geometry affects charge

confined systems. The study examined two distinct central regions, which
included a circular disc and a regular hexagonal area that connected to
semi-infinite zigzag and armchair borophene nanoribbon leads. The system was
described by a five-band tight-binding Hamiltonian parameterized using
first-principles data, and the transport properties were calculated within the
non-equilibrium Green's function framework. Spin resolved transmissions and
spin polarization were computed for a range of lead widths and
proximity-induced exchange field strengths. The analysis revealed distinct
transport characteristics determined by geometry and edge configuration:
armchair-connected structures exhibited broader and more stable fully
spin-polarized windows compared with zigzag-connected counterparts.
Furthermore, critical lead-width thresholds ($\approx 1.01$ nm for zigzag and
$\approx 0.87$ nm for armchair) and a moderate exchange field above which
complete spin filtering occurs were identified. The results highlight the
strong influence of edge termination and confinement geometry on transport
properties and provide useful design guidelines for developing borophene-based
nanoscale spintronic devices.

Abstract: Artificial spin ices (ASIs) provide a versatile platform to explore magnetic
frustration and emergent phenomena. However, in kagome ASI, experimental access
to the ground state remains elusive due to dynamical freezing. Here, we
demonstrate a deterministic and rewritable approach to attain the ground state
using ultrafast, site-selective laser annealing. By engineering
sublattice-dependent optical absorption through selective capping of the
nanomagnets with Cr or utilizing different nanomagnet thicknesses, we achieve
selective partial demagnetization of one sublattice under a sub-coercive
magnetic field, driving the system into the ground state in a single switching
step. Magnetic force microscopy reveals nearly perfect long-range ordering,
while heat-transfer simulations confirm the sublattice-selective excitation
mechanism. This work establishes an ultrafast method to attain the kagome ASI
ground state, which does not require a modification of the geometry of the ASI
or the materials used for the individual nanomagnets. Beyond ground-state
writing, this site-selective activation provides an important tool for
controlling the magnetic states, which is important for applications such as
reconfigurable magnonic crystals, neuromorphic computing and programmable
nanomagnetic logic.

Abstract: Altermagnets combine zero net magnetization with giant spin splitting,
enabling spin-polarized transport without strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC).
Deterministically selecting the conducting spin channel, however, requires
breaking the 90 degree rotation and time-reversal antisymmetry (C4zT). Using
standard axial vector transformation rules as preliminaries, we show that in
monolayer Ta2TeSeO this can be achieved naturally and tuned in a symmetry
efficient way by rotating the Neel vector. Without considering the Neel vector,
Ta2TeSeO has one pair of mirror protected spin polarized Weyl points in each
spin channel. Aligning the Neel vector along the crystallographic x or y
direction breaks the mirror symmetry Mx or My, inducing selective mirror
symmetry breaking that keeps one spin sector gapless and opens a gap in the
opposite spin, yielding fully spin polarized transport. The C2z symmetry
breaking makes the preserved two Weyl points inequivalent, turning the half
semimetal into a half metallic state. The same orientation selective symmetry
reduction applies to lattice vibrations, implying phonon chirality splitting.
Owing to the near degenerate in plane anisotropy, reversible zero moment
switching is achievable with minute in plane strain or weak magnetic fields,
and the lattice coupling suggests control by circularly polarized light. The
mechanism extends to other two dimensional decorated Lieb altermagnets lacking
horizontal mirror Mz, providing a general low power route to spin filtering and
logic.

devices function by electrically manipulating the collective dynamics of the
electron spin, that is inherently non-volatile, nonlinear and fast-operating,

magnetic Ising machines. We discuss hardware-specific and task-dependent
