Abstract: A thin-walled tubular superconductor develops a quantized fluxoid in the
presence of an axial magnetic field. The fluxoid corresponds to the number of
phase windings of the superconducting order parameter and is topological in
nature. When the tube has a radius variation along the axial direction, forming
a bottleneck structure between sections with different radius, a fluxoid
mismatch can appear depending on the applied magnetic field. The bottleneck
then becomes a topological boundary and is host to topologically protected
solutions for the order parameter, dubbed fluxoid solitons, that are free to
move around bottlenecks with cylindrical symmetry. Fluxoid solitons are a new
type of vortex with non-quantized flux, loosely related to Pearl vortices in
thin superconducting films and fluxons in Corbino Josephson junctions. We
characterize their properties as a function of system parameters using the
self-consistent quasiclassical theory of diffusive superconductors. We consider
both short bottleneck structures and long tapered tubes, where multiple trapped
fluxoid solitons adopt elaborate arrangements dictated by their mutual
repulsion.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Metal hydrides MHx with low hydrogen content are not expected to show high-Tc
superconductivity owing to the low hydrogen-derived electronic density of
states at Fermi level and the limited hydrogen contribution to electron-phonon
coupling strength. In this work, we report on the successful synthesis of a
novel bismuth dihydride superconductor, Cmcm-BiH$_2$, at approximately 150 GPa,
and the discovery of superconductivity with Tc about 62 K at 163 GPa, marking
the first instance of superconductor among the MH$_2$-type metal dihydrides.
Cmcm-BiH$_2$ adopts a unique host-guest type structure, in which the Bi atoms
via weak Bi-Bi covalent bonds form a three-dimensional open-channel framework
that encapsulates H$_2$-like molecules as guests, thereby broadening the
structural diversity of hydrides under high pressures. The occurrence of
superconductivity is evidenced by a sharp drop of resistivity to zero and the
characteristic downward shift of Tc under applied magnetic fields. Notably,
Cmcm-BiH$_2$ remains stable down to at least 97 GPa during decompression, with
the calculated lowest pressure for dynamic stability of 10 GPa. In-depth
analysis reveals that the covalent bismuth open-channel structure forms
metallic conduction channels, dominates the electronic states near the Fermi
level, and contributes approximately 51% of the total $lambda$ in Cmcm-BiH$_2$,
distinguishing it from known high-pressure hydride superconductors. These
findings highlight the critical role of non-hydrogen elements in producing
superconductivity and open new avenues for the design and optimization of
high-Tc hydride superconductors.

Abstract: We investigate the strain response of underdoped HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta}$
(Hg1201), by synchrotron X-ray diffraction and corresponding simulations of
thermal diffuse scattering. The compression in the crystallographic $a$
direction leads to relatively small expansion in the $b$ and $c$ directions,
with Poisson ratios $\nu_{ba}$=0.16 and $\nu_{ca}$=0.11, respectively. However,
the Cu-O distance in the $c$ direction exhibits a notable 0.9% increase at 1.1%
$a$-axis compression. We further find strain-induced diffuse scattering which
corresponds to a new type of two-dimensional charge correlation. Interestingly,
this signal is insensitive to the onset of superconductivity and instead
corresponds to a short-range, nearly commensurate modulation with a wave vector
close to (0.5, 0, 0) and a correlation length of approximately four unit cells.
It closely resembles the charge order theoretically predicted in the phase
diagram of the spin-liquid model with resonating valence bonds on a square
lattice.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The recent discovery of unconventional superconductivity has pointed to
twisted WSe$_2$ bilayer as a versatile platform for studying the correlated and
topological phases of matter. Here we analyze the effect of the displacement
field and electron interactions on the formation of a topological paired state
in twisted WSe$_2$. Our approach is based on the effective single band
$t$-$J$-$U$ model supplemented with intersite Coulomb interaction term and
treated within the Gutzwiller approximation. We show that the superconducting
phase is stabilized in a small range of displacement fields where the Van Hove
singularity crosses half-filling, which is in qualitative agreement with recent
experimental data. According to our analysis, such a circumstance comes as a
result of a subtle interplay between the large density of states of the Van
Hove singularity, in combination with the renormalization effects that appear
in the weak-to-moderate correlations regime. The two factors create favorable
conditions for the SC pairing only in a small area of the phase diagram.

Abstract: In this work, I employ parabolic cylinder functions to quantitatively
describe the ARPES spectra of an over-doped Bi2212 across the temperature range
6 - 140K at the antinode k-point. These functions come from the solutions of a
particle moving in a system of random scatterers. The parameters, i.e. the
overall amplitude (A), the spectral coherence scale (C), and the energy shift
(EG), are determined directly by fitting to experimental data. At 140K, the
dominated feature of the ARPES spectrum resembles the solution of a particle
moving in a one-dimensional random system. According to the present model, the
electronic states of the over-doped Bi2212 at the antinode k-point can be
viewed as a realization of the theory of a particle moving in dynamic
scatterers in 1D with corrections from the ground state solutions at lower
temperature.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Since Landau's theory, polarons have been understood as quasiparticles in
which charges are dressed by the lattice field, yet decades of transport and
spectroscopic studies have yielded only static indirect renormalizations.
Whether such dressing can dynamically reorganize electronic spectra to generate
new quantum-coherent states has remained unresolved. Here we use femtosecond
coherent multidimensional spectroscopy on size and composition controlled
perovskite quantum dots to track polaronic field-induced dynamics in real time,
revealing their consequences. We observe a delayed condensation into a confined
spectrum of coherent states on 50-150 fs timescales, with couplings between
these states evolving dynamically on the same timescale. The splittings are
robust, exhibit anomalous linear size dependence, exceed single-particle
splittings and manifest at 300 K. A Raman-constrained spin-boson Hamiltonian
captures both the anomalous scaling and dynamical onset, establishing polarons
as generators of coherent manifolds that enable collective quantum phenomena
including superradiance, superfluorescence and superabsorption.

Abstract: Electrons levitating above the surface of solid neon have recently emerged as
a promising platform for high-quality qubits. The morphology and uniformity of
the neon growth in these systems is crucial for qubit performance in a scalable
architecture. Here we report on the controlled growth and characterization of
thin solid neon films using multiplexed superconducting microwave resonators.
By monitoring changes in the resonant frequency and internal quality factor
($Q_i$) of an array of frequency multiplexed quarter-wave coplanar waveguide
resonators, we quantify the spatial uniformity of the film. A pulsed gas
deposition protocol near the neon triple point results in repeatable film
formation, generating measurable shifts in frequency and variations in $Q_i$
across the resonator array. Notably, introducing a post-deposition anneal at 12
K for one hour improves the film homogeneity, as shown by the reduced
resonator-to-resonator variance in frequency and $Q_i$, consistent with
enhanced wetting. These results demonstrate resonator-based metrology as an
in-situ tool for characterising neon film growth, directly supporting the
development of electron on inert quantum solid qubit platforms.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect, whereby chiral molecules
preferentially transmit electrons of one spin orientation, remains one of the
most intriguing and debated phenomena at the interface of spintronics,
molecular electronics, and quantum materials. Despite extensive experimental
observations across diverse platforms - including transport junctions,
photoemission, and enantioselective chemistry - a comprehensive theoretical
framework is still lacking. In this perspective, we critically examine the
spinterface mechanism as a unifying explanation for the CISS effect. The
spinterface model, which hypothesizes a feedback interaction between electron
motion in chiral molecules and fluctuating surface magnetic moments, is shown
to quantitatively reproduce experimental data across various systems and
conditions. We contrast it with some existing theoretical models, highlighting
key experimental features. Importantly, we also address open questions and
criticisms of this model, including the nature of surface magnetism, the role
of dissipation, and the applicability of the mechanism to non-helical or
electrode-free systems. By offering falsifiable predictions and reconciling
theory with experimental raw data, this work aims to sharpen the dialogue
surrounding the microscopic origin of CISS and stimulate further experimental
and theoretical progress.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We study the structural relaxation and electronic properties of a
one-dimensional (1D) moir\'e system composed of a zigzag graphene nanoribbon
(GNR) placed on a hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) substrate. Using an effective
grid model derived from continuum elasticity theory, we calculate the relaxed
atomic structure of the GNR/hBN system for various twist angles and ribbon
widths. The relaxation gives rise to a characteristic 1D domain structure
consisting of alternating commensurate AB$'$ regions and two distinct types of
domain boundaries. At finite twist angles, the ribbon adopts a wavy shape,
locally tracing the hBN zigzag direction but occasionally sliding to adjacent
atomic rows. The resulting moir\'e potential strongly modulates the electronic
structure: the zero-energy zigzag edge states are modulated by the local
stacking, leading to densely packed subbands in the AB$'$ domains and sharply
localized domain-wall states in the energy gaps between domain plateaus, which
together realize gate-tunable one-dimensional arrays of quantum-confined
electronic states. Our results demonstrate that moir\'e modulation in GNR/hBN
heterostructures provides a versatile platform for electronic structure
engineering and the design of 1D moir\'e nanodevices.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Precise probe and control of various quantum degrees of freedom in novel
quantum matter are central to understanding fundamental quantum physics and
hold promise for innovative routes to encode and process information. Chirality
is one such degree of freedom that has recently attracted intense research
interest, especially for Weyl fermions in topological Weyl semimetals. The
coupling of chiral degrees of freedom through light-matter interactions and the
versatile control of these couplings through external fields can lead to
precise quantum control of Weyl fermions. In this work, we demonstrate the
observation of light chirality-dependent photocurrent in the mid-infrared
regime. Excitation wavelength-dependent measurements reveal that the
photocurrent originates from the injection of chiral polarized Weyl fermions by
chiral polarized mid-infrared photons. The optical process that generates
unbalanced chiral polarized Weyl fermions is determined to be a third-order
nonlinear photocurrent process. Compared with nonmagnetic Weyl semimetals, such
coupling is versatilely tunable in magnetic Weyl semimetals with the
magnetization direction and external electric field in addition to the
chirality of light. Our results are not only directly applicable to tunable
circular-polarization-sensitive photodetection in the mid-infrared regime, but
also pave the way toward functional quantum devices that utilize the chiral
quantum degrees of freedom of Weyl fermions.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The electrical generation of spin signals is of central interest for
spintronics, where graphene stands as a relevant platform as its spin-orbit
coupling (SOC) is tuned by proximity effects. Here, we propose an enhancement
of spin-charge interconversion in graphene by controlling the intraparticle
entanglement between the spin and pseudospin degrees of freedom. We demonstrate
that, although the spin alone is not conserved in Rashba-Dirac systems, a
combined spin-pseudospin operator is conserved. This conserved quantity
represents the interconversion between pure spin and pseudospin textures to a
spin-pseudospin entangled structure, where Kane-Mele SOC tunes this balance. By
these means, we achieve spin-charge interconversion of 100\% efficiency via the
Rashba-Edelstein effect. Quantum transport simulations in disordered
micron-size systems demonstrate the robustness of this effect, and also reveal
a disorder resilient spin Hall effect generated by the interplay between Rashba
and Kane-Mele SOC. Our findings propose a platform for maximally efficient
spin-charge interconversion, and establish spin-pseudospin correlations as a
mechanism to tailor spintronic devices.

the obtained experimental data on the spin-Hall effect, an assessment of the
spin-orbit interaction in the studied paramagnets was made.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Ferrimagnetic Fe/Gd multilayers host maze-like stripe domains that transform
into a disordered bubble/skyrmion lattice under out-of-plane magnetic fields at
ambient temperature. Femtosecond magneto-optics distinguishes these textures
via their distinct coherent breathing dynamics. Crucially, applying a brief
in-plane ``set'' magnetic field to the stripe state enhances both frequency and
amplitude of the bubble/skyrmion lattice breathing mode. Lorentz transmission
electron microscopy, magnetic force microscopy, and micromagnetic simulations
reveal that this enhancement arises from field-aligned stripes nucleating a
dense, near-hexagonal bubble/skyrmion lattice upon out-of-plane field
application, with strong indications for a pure skyrmion lattice. Thus,
modifying the initial domain configuration by in-plane fields enables precise
control of coherent magnetization dynamics on picosecond to nanosecond
timescales and potentially even of topology.

Abstract: Through systematic experimental and theoretical studies of
layer-thickness-dependent absorption in semiconducting MoSe$_2$ and WS$_2$
across the visible to near-infrared spectral range, we demonstrate a universal
absorption behavior in solids at nanoscale thicknesses. With increasing
thickness, a non-monotonic evolution of absorption integrated over the measured
spectral region is revealed which is accompanied by pronounced oscillatory
features. This strongly deviates from the expected Beer-Lambert law. The
observed behavior has origins in the electromagnetic interference effects
taking place between the two surfaces of the thin crystals. The present work on
2D semiconductors is extendable to all kinds of solids such as conventional
semiconductors (e.g. Si, GaAs, GaN, InP), (semi)metals (e.g. Al, Ag, Au,
c-HOPG) and 2D magnetic materials (e.g. CrSBr and NiPS$_3$). Our results
provide fundamental insights into light-matter interactions in solids at the
nanoscale and are vital for optimally designing the new generation of
absorption-based flexible optoelectronic devices.

Abstract: Spin filtering and its back-action spin transfer torque (STT) are key
ingredients of latest spintronic devices based on magnetic tunnel junctions
(MTJs). Resonant tunneling (RT), implemented by design or occurring as
parasitic effects, is known to crucially affect macroscopic device performance,
but direct experimental access to its individual microscopic processes has
remained difficult. Here we apply the RT scheme from MTJs to spin-polarized
scanning tunneling microscopy (SP-STM) for ultimate miniaturization obtained by
addressing distinct sites on individual nanomagnets. Combined with energy
selectivity, our experimental model set-up enables to study the spin filtering
capabilities of RT through an individual spin-split vacuum resonance state and
of the corresponding STT exerted on the nanomagnet. We find, that the sign and
magnitude of the STT follow the effective spin-polarization of the resonance
state, which, as we show, can by tailored on demand either by adjusting the
applied bias or the current injection point on the nanostructure. We
anticipate, that our atomic-scale RT-MTJ approach and the discovery of a
versatile tunable spin-filter at smallest scale will prove invaluable for
studying and designing next generation MTJs potentially based on recently
discovered 2D van-der-Waals magnets or altermagnets.

Abstract: Many monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides, including MoS$_2$, MoSe$_2$,
WS$_2$, and WSe$_2$, are direct bandgap two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors
with sharp optical resonances at excitonic bound state frequencies. Recent
experiments have demonstrated that excitonic resonance frequencies in
multilayer van der Waals stacks are altered by long-range Coulomb interactions
with electrons in nearby but electrically isolated 2D materials. These
modulations have been successfully used to detect transitions between distinct
states of remote strongly correlated 2D electron fluids. In this Letter we
provide a theory of these frequency shifts, enabling a more quantitative
interpretation of excitonic-sensing experiments, and apply it as an example to
WSe$_2$ that is proximate to graphene bilayers and multilayers.

Abstract: MgO single crystals with diameters between 3.5 and 5 mm and lengths up to 40
mm were grown by the optical floating zone technique (OFZ). Despite challenging
material properties such as the high melting point of 2825 {\deg}C, very high
evaporation rate and perfect {100} cleaving characteristics, crack-free
crystals were grown at high growth rates exceeding 40 mm/h and at high thermal
gradients. Chemical investigations revealed that the OFZ technique is suitable
for the preparation of substrate crystals with a purity of 5N to facilitate the
development of novel demonstrator devices based on epitaxially grown thin
films. The achieved purity level is improved by more than one order of
magnitude if compared to commercial MgO substrate single crystals graded as
high purity.

Abstract: We present density-functional-theory calculations which provide a microscopic
picture of the recombination-enhanced migration of interstitial Mg in GaN. We
determine stable structures and migration pathways with accurate HSE
approximation to the exchange-correlation energy, and also computed
recombination rates using the obtained energy spectrum and wavefunctions. It is
found that the migration between the most stable octahedral sites
(Mg$_{\textrm{O}}$) via newly found interstitial complex structure shows the
lowest migration energy in which one or two electrons are captured during the
migration, that the most stable charge state of 2+ changes to 1+ or neutral,
and that by this recombination of carriers the migration barrier is
significantly reduced. Starting from Mg$_{\textrm{O}}^{2+}$, Mg captures an
electron becoming the 1+ charge state and overcomes the barrier of 1.65 eV,
much reduced from 2.23 eV in case of the migration with the 2+ charge state
kept. Moreover, further electron capture is realized accompanied by substantial
structural relaxation, thus Mg becoming neutral. Detailed HSE calculations for
this second capture show that the migration barrier is 1.55 eV, thus clarifying
the important role of the carrier recombination for Mg migration in GaN. These
findings are corroborated by the present quantitative calculations of
recombination rates based on electronic Hamiltonian constructed from our
DFT-obtained energy spectrum. The timescale of the recombination is clarified
to be in or under the timescale of the migration with typical electron density
and the enhancement is expected to be significant.

Abstract: An important feature of Cr3+ is the ability to tune the absorption and
emission spectra by changing the host. However, in some cases, different
emission spectra can be detected in samples with similar Racah parameters. The
present paper reports changes in the luminescence properties of Cr3+:YGG
nanocrystals. Cr3+:YGG nanocrystals were synthesized by a modified Pechini
method to obtain nanocrystals containing two fractions of Cr3+:YGG nanocrystals
with different lattice parameters and crystalline sizes. The increase in the
concentration of Cr3+ ions leads to a redshift of the 4T2g emission from 750 nm
to 850 nm for luminescence spectra measured at 80K. In contrast, room
temperature luminescence spectra showed similarity in the shape of the emission
spectra. The calculated crystal field strength was found to increase with the
concentration of Cr3+ ions, so the detected patterns in low-temperature
luminescence spectra were explained by energy transfer chain processes.

Abstract: Developing efficient Er3+,Yb3+:YAG eye-safe lasers is a priority of modern
laser technology. This paper focuses on the influence of the concentration of
Yb3+ ions on the spectroscopic properties of Er3+,Yb3+:YAG transparent
ceramics. Four samples with different concentrations of Yb3+ ions were prepared
by solid-state reaction sintering. The study revealed the influence of Yb3+
ions on the microstructure and the sintering process. A high concentration of
Yb3+ ions leads to the formation of Y3+-rich impurity phases and causes
segregation of Er3+ and Yb3+ and Si4+ into these phases. The influence of Yb3+
ions on the shape of emission spectra and the lifetimes of both Er3+ and Yb3+
ions was shown. Changes in the spectroscopic properties were ascribed to
increase in neat transfer between Yb3+ and Er3+ ions. IQE of Er3+ and Yb3+
luminescence were calculated, and optimal Er3+/Yb3+ ions ratio were proposed

Abstract: Non-Hermitian physics characterized by complex band spectra has established a
new paradigm in condensed matter systems and metamaterials. Recently,
non-Hermitian gain and nonreciprocity are deliberately introduced to valley
manipulation, leading to various phenomena beyond the Hermitian scenarios, such
as the amplified topological whispering gallery modes as an acoustic laser. In
contrast, pure loss is inevitable in practice and generally regarded as a
detrimental factor. Here, we reveal that the coupling loss can manipulate
valley degrees of freedom in a phononic metamaterial. Three distinct
valley-related effects, including valley-resolved nonreciprocity that functions
as a valley filter, valley-dependent skin effects where bulk states from
different valleys localize at opposite boundaries, and valley-projected edge
states with boundary-dependent lifetimes that leads to an anomalous beam
splitting, are demonstrated through theoretical analysis and airborne sound
experiments. Owing to the easy preparation of loss, our findings shed light on
both non-Hermitian and valley physics and may facilitate innovative
applications of valley-related devices.

Abstract: Semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), such as MoSe$_2$ and
WSe$_2$, exhibit unique optical and electronic properties. Vertical stacking of
layers of one or more TMDs, to create heterostructures, has expanded the fields
of moir\'e physics and twistronics. Bottom-up fabrication techniques, such as
chemical vapor deposition, have advanced the creation of heterostructures
beyond what was possible with mechanical exfoliation and stacking. These
techniques now enable the fabrication of lateral heterostructures, where two or
more monolayers are covalently bonded in the plane of their atoms. At their
atomically sharp interfaces, lateral heterostructures exhibit additional
phenomena, such as the formation of charge-transfer excitons, in which the
electron and hole reside on opposite sides of the interface. Due to the energy
landscape created by differences in the band structures of the constituent
materials, unique effects such as unidirectional exciton transport and
excitonic lensing can be observed in lateral heterostructures. This review
outlines recent progress in exciton dynamics and spectroscopy of TMD-based
lateral heterostructures and offers an outlook on future developments in
excitonics in this promising system.

Abstract: Altermagnets are a recently-discovered class of materials with magnetic
ordering that have a zero net magnetization and a momentum-dependent spin
splitting in their band structure, arising from a collinear spin arrangement
with alternating polarizations in the crystal lattice. The nickeline-structured
manganese telluride ({\alpha}-MnTe) is an attractive altermagnet candidate due
to its predicted large spin splitting energy and a transition temperature near
300K. In this work, we present a thorough investigation of the spin structure
of {\alpha}-MnTe thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy with very high
crystal quality and low residual magnetization. The epitaxial {\alpha}-MnTe
films have a full-width-at-half-maximum of 0.1{\deg} as measured by
x-ray-diffraction rocking curves and a root-mean-square roughness below 1 nm.
Neutron diffraction measurements confirm the antiferromagnetic order in the
{\alpha}-MnTe film and show a N\'eel temperature of 307 K. Polarized neutron
reflectometry detects a vanishingly small net magnetization which may be
confined to the MnTe/InP interface, highlighting the near-ideal stoichiometry
in the sample. In vacuo angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy reveals that
the bulk band spectrum of the MnTe films is consistent with the weak
altermagnetic order as theoretically predicted and observed for the high
symmetry nodal plane in the center of the Brillouin zone. This study
establishes optimized growth conditions for the synthesis of stoichiometric
{\alpha}-MnTe thin films which exhibit exceptional structural and magnetic
ordering, thereby providing a robust platform for the precise characterization
of their altermagnetic properties.

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) phase-change materials (PCMs) with moderate transition
barriers and distinctly contrasting properties are highly desirable for
multifunctional devices, yet such systems remain scarce. Using first-principles
calculations, we propose a hexagonal InOI monolayer as a promising 2D PCM. This
material exhibits two distinct polymorphs: an energetically favorable
T$^{\prime}$ phase and a metastable T phase, differentiated by iodine atom
positions. The T$^{\prime}$-to-T structural phase transition features a
moderate energy barrier $E_b$ of 72.1 meV per formula unit, facilitating
reversible switching. Notably, strain engineering tailors the electronic
transition, inducing either a metal-to-topological-insulator or a
metal-to-normal-insulator transformation. Additionally, this phase transition
modulates the piezoelectric response and shifts optical absorption from the
infrared to the visible range. These multifunctional properties make 2D
hexagonal InOI highly promising for applications in non-volatile memory,
low-contact-resistance spintronics, and optical switching devices.

Abstract: We present polarization-resolved optical absorption measurements on Er3+ ions
in CaWO4 under vector magnetic fields, focusing on charge-compensated sites
arising from local Ca2+ vacancies. While the known axial Er3+ site displays a
single symmetric Zeeman-split transition pattern consistent with S4 symmetry,
two additional sites exhibit more complex spectral behavior, including sets of
transitions that interchange under 90{\deg} crystal rotations-evidence of
reduced, rhombic-like symmetry. From these polarization- and
temperature-dependent spectra, we extract effective g-factors. Our findings are
corroborated by electron paramagnetic resonance measurements and support a
model of multiple inequivalent Ca2+ vacancies around Er3+ sites in the host
lattice. This detailed characterization contributes to understanding
defect-engineered rare-earth sites for quantum information applications.

Abstract: Metamaterials derive their unconventional properties from engineered
microstructures, with periodic lattices providing a versatile framework for
modeling wave propagation. Dispersion relations, obtained from Bloch-Floquet
theory, govern how waves propagate, attenuate, or localize within such systems.
Extending interactions beyond nearest neighbors, through nonlocality,
substantially enriches the design space of band diagrams, enabling phenomena
such as negative or zero group velocities, roton-like extrema, and band-gap
localization. However, existing approaches to dispersion tailoring often rely
on analytical formulations or Fourier-based identifications, which become
impractical for complex coupling mechanisms and offer limited control over
physical constraints such as stiffness positivity. This work introduces a
general interpolation-based framework for customizing dispersion relations in
uniform nonlocal lattices. Rather than reconstructing full dispersion curves,
the method enforces prescribed frequency-wavenumber points as interpolation
constraints, enabling localized and tunable control of wave behavior. The
formulation is applied to both spring- and beam-interaction lattices, and
demonstrated on an Euler-Bernoulli beam model with adjustable nonlocal
couplings. Through systematic parameter tuning, the framework enables the
creation of rotons, the adjustment of group-velocity dispersion, and the design
of evanescent waves with controlled exponential decay within band gaps, all
while ensuring real, positive-only stiffness parameters and passive mechanical
behavior. Altogether, this parametric interpolation strategy provides a
physically consistent and computationally efficient route for engineering
advanced phononic functionalities in periodic nonlocal systems.

Abstract: Chirality is a pervasive property of matter that underpins many important
phenomena across physics, chemistry and biology. Given its broad significance,
the development of protocols for rational control of chirality in solid state
systems is highly desirable, especially if this effect can be tuned
continuously and in two directions. Yet, this goal has remained elusive due to
the absence of a universal conjugate field that couples linearly to this
structural order. Here, we introduce the piezochiral effect, which enables
control of chirality through mechanical strain. We first show by symmetry
analysis that uniaxial strain induces chirality in a broad class of achiral
crystals that host fragments of opposite chirality within each unit cell, an
effect that has so far remained unrecognized. The strain-induced handedness can
be tuned either by changing the strain direction or by switching between
compressive and tensile strain. We experimentally verify this effect in AgGaS2,
using measurements of the optical activity under strain. Our discovery
establishes a new scheme for chirality control, with potential applications
that range from spintronics to asymmetric catalysis, and enantioselective
interactions in biosystems.
