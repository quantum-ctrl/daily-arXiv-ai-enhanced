Abstract: The progress of magnonics ultimately depends on material platforms that offer precise control of spin waves propagation. Here, we put forward a chemical strategy to create locally tunable magnonic crystals by integrating switchable spin-crossover (SCO) molecules with 2D van der Waals magnets. Specifically, we investigate from first principles a hybrid molecular/2D heterostructure formed by [Fe((3,5-(CH3)2Pz)3BH)2] molecules (Fe-pz) deposited on a single-layer of semiconducting CrSBr. We show that Fe-pz molecules are stable on CrSBr while preserving its SCO bistability, particularly in densely packed molecular arrays. By patterning Fe-pz into periodic stripes separated by pristine CrSBr regions, the interface becomes a magnonic crystal that filters spin waves at selected frequencies. Crucially, light-driven excited spin-state trapping (LIESST) enables LS-HS switching and induces up to ~1.3% local strain in CrSBr, which in turn reshapes the magnonic band structure in a dynamic and reversible manner. These results establish Fe-pz@CrSBr as a switchable platform for on-chip, programmable magnonic devices.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We employ correlation-consistent effective core potentials (ccECPs) to perform exact or nearly exact correlation and total energy calculations for the fifth-row elements (Rb-Xe). Total energies are calculated using various correlated methods: configuration interaction (CI), coupled-cluster (CC) up to perturbative quadruple excitations whenever feasible, and stochastic quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) approaches. In order to estimate the energy at the complete basis set (CBS) limit, the basis sets are constructed systematically through aug-cc-p(C)VnZ for each ccECP and further extrapolated to the CBS limit within the corresponding methods. Kinetic energies are evaluated at the FCI/CISD level to provide insights into the electron density and localization of the ccECPs. We also provide data sets for widely used diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) to quantify fixed-node biases with single-reference trial wavefunctions. These comprehensive benchmarks validate the accuracy of ccECPs within the CC, CI, and QMC methodologies, thus providing accurate and tested valence-only Hamiltonians for many-body electronic structure calculations.

Abstract: Kagome lattice bilayers offer unique opportunities for engineering electronic properties through interlayer stacking and strain. We report a comprehensive first-principles study of Pd$_3$O$_2$Cl$_2$ kagome bilayers, examining four stacking configurations (AA, AA$'$, AB, AB$'$). Our calculations reveal dramatic stacking-dependent band gap modulation from 0.08 to 0.76~eV, with the AB$'$ configuration being the most thermodynamically stable. All stackings exhibit robust mechanical stability with Young's moduli of 54.82-61.97~N/m and ductile behavior suitable for flexible electronics. Carrier effective masses show significant stacking dependence, ranging from 2.39-6.35~$m_0$ for electrons and 0.67-1.55~$m_0$ for holes. Strain engineering of the AB$'$ bilayer demonstrates non-monotonic band gap tuning and asymmetric modulation of carrier masses, with hole effective masses showing stronger strain sensitivity. These results establish Pd$_3$O$_2$Cl$_2$ bilayers as a promising platform for strain-engineered kagome-based quantum devices, where stacking order and mechanical deformation provide complementary control over electronic transport.

Abstract: We introduce 3D-DPhyne, a novel three-dimensional (3D) carbon allotrope derived from the dodecaphenylyne framework, and investigate its structural, electronic, optical, and mechanical properties using first-principles calculations. The proposed structure forms a tetragonal, topologically complex network of four-, six-, and twelve-membered carbon rings with mixed sp/sp^2 hybridization and a formation energy of -7.87 eV/atom, comparable to other stable carbon allotropes. Phonon dispersion calculations show no imaginary modes, and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations at 1000~K confirm robust thermal stability without bond breaking. Electronic structure analysis reveals metallic character, with multiple bands crossing the Fermi level and dominant contributions from carbon p orbitals, consistent with a fully delocalized 3D $π$-conjugated network. The optical response is anisotropic, exhibiting strong absorption in the visible and ultraviolet regions and low reflectivity across a broad range of photon energies. Mechanical analysis reveals pronounced elastic anisotropy, with Young's modulus varying from approximately 40 to 490 GPa depending on direction. Poisson's ratio displays unconventional directional behavior, including auxetic-like responses.

Abstract: The effect of Ga substitution on the electronic, magnetic, and low-energy responses of the Zintl phase EuZn$_2$P$_2$ is investigated by electrical transport, electron spin resonance (ESR), and terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS). Incorporating Ga into EuZn$_2$P$_2$ (EuZn$_{1.8}$Ga$_{0.2}$P$_2$) reduces the electrical resistivity, indicating enhanced free-carrier density and a narrowed semiconducting gap. ESR confirms the persistence of Eu$^{2+}$ moments while showing a crossover from a Lorentzian to a Dysonian lineshape, consistent with reduced skin depth, increased carrier density, and the emergence of diffusive contributions. Ga-substituted compound display pronounced negative magnetoresistance linked to magnetic-polaron formation. THz-TDS reveals strong low-frequency absorption and a notable enhancement of the Drude conductivity in the substituted material, together with an increased carrier scattering time and enhanced carrier-density--to--effective-mass ratio. These results demonstrate that Ga substitution tunes charge transport, carrier dynamics, and short-range magnetic correlations in EuZn$_2$P$_2$, establishing EuZn$_{1.8}$Ga$_{0.2}$P$_2$ as a promising platform for engineering correlated narrow-gap magnetic semiconductors with enhanced electronic and spin-dependent functionalities.

Abstract: We conducted a comprehensive study on the compositional dependence of the anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) in amorphous (amo.) Tb-Fe-Co thin films. The anomalous Nernst coefficient strongly depends not only on the Tb composition but also on the transition metal composition, reaching a maximum of 1.8 uV/K for amo. Tb11.0(Fe50.0Co50.0) 89.0. By evaluating the electrical and thermoelectric properties, it was clarified that this maximum is achieved by the superposition of two large contributions: S_1 arising from direct transverse electron conduction due to a temperature gradient, and S_2 resulting from the combined Seebeck and anomalous Hall effects. We discovered that the anomalous Nernst conductivity, which is attributed to Berry curvature, varied significantly with the transition metal, even in an amorphous material lacking long-range crystalline order. Our research indicates that it is possible to control the electronic states that influence thermoelectric properties, even in the amorphous state.

Abstract: Here we investigate the electronic structure of the tetragonal tungsten bronze Ba$_{3-x}$Yb$_x$Ta$_{5}$O$_{15}$ by making use of hard x-ray photoemission spectroscopy. The core level spectroscopy shows that the substitution with Yb ions in the series first occurs on the compact S1 site. For $x\leq1$, Yb is found to be dominantly Yb$^{2+}$ with a small mixing of Yb$^{3+}$, while for $x>1$, a significant increase of Yb$^{3+}$ is found, suggesting not only that site S2 favours Yb$^{3+}$, but also that their presence affects also the valency of the ions in site S1. The valence band spectra shows a relatively deep Yb$^{2+}$ doublet, but at the same time indications of a Ta~$5d$-Yb~$4f$ interaction are found, suggesting the presence of Yb~$4f$ carriers at the Fermi level through this hybridization. Our results thus point towards an exotic form of $d$-$f$ electronic interplay that together with the structural degrees of freedom can result in the unusual trends observed in the physical properties of Ba$_{3-x}$Yb$_x$Ta$_{5}$O$_{15}$.

Abstract: Understanding atomic structures is crucial, yet amorphous materials remain challenging due to their irregular and non-periodic nature. The wavelet-transform radial distribution function (WT-RDF) offers a physics-based framework for analyzing amorphous structures, reliably predicting the first and second RDF peaks and overall curve trends in both binary Ge 0.25 Se 0.75 and ternary Ag x(Ge 0.25 Se 0.75)100-x (x=5,10,15,20,25) systems. Despite these strengths, WT-RDF shows limitations in amplitude accuracy, which affects quantitative analyses such as coordination numbers. This study addresses the issue by optimizing WT-RDF parameters using a machine learning approach, producing the enhanced WT-RDF+ framework. WT-RDF+ improves the precision of peak predictions and outperforms benchmark ML models, including RBF and LSTM, even when trained on only 25 percent of the binary dataset. These results demonstrate that WT-RDF+ is a robust and reliable model for structural characterization of amorphous materials, particularly Ge-Se systems, and support the efficient design and development of phase-change thin films for next-generation electronic devices and components.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Spin chirality provides a powerful route to control magnetic and topological phases in materials, enabling next-generation spintronic and quantum technologies. Coplanar noncollinear antiferromagnets with Kagome lattice spin geometries host vector spin chirality (VSC), the handedness of spin arrangement, and offer an excellent platform for chirality-driven phase control. However, the microscopic mechanisms governing VSC switching and its coupling to magnetic order, electronic structure, and quantum geometry remain elusive, with experimental evidence still lacking. Here, we present conclusive experimental evidence of temperature-driven VSC switching in an archetypal noncollinear antiferromagnetic manganese chromium nitride (Mn3CrN) epitaxial thin films. The VSC switching induces a concomitant quantum-geometric and Lifshitz transition, manifested through a pronounced peak in anomalous Hall conductivity remanence, a metal-insulator-like crossover in longitudinal resistivity, and a distinct evolution of x-ray magnetic circular dichroic signal. The reversal of VSC reconstructs the spin configuration, Fermi surface topology and Berry curvature, marking a unified magnetic-electronic-quantum geometric transition. This emergent behaviour, captured through magneto-transport and magneto-optic measurements, and supported by first-principles theory establish VSC as an active control knob for chirality-driven phase engineering and the design of multifunctional quantum devices.

Abstract: Understanding and manipulating two-dimensional materials for real-world applications remains challenging due to a lack of effective and high-throughput characterization techniques. Soft X-ray time-of-flight photoemission electron microscopy (XPEEM) provides element- and depth-sensitive information of materials and buried interfaces. However, chromatic and spherical aberrations cannot be corrected with electron-lens combinations. These aberrations, combined with astigmatism and space-charge effects, significantly degrade the spatial and energy resolutions. To overcome this limitation, we outline a spatial-attention based deep learning approach to automatically correct for these effects and attain nanometer resolution over the entire field-of-view (FoV). The combination of this corrective algorithm with XPEEM, termed as nanoXPEEM, establishes a new record of 48-nm spatial resolution with a 232-micrometer diameter FoV in the soft x-ray regime (700-1000 eV). nanoXPEEM provides unique spatial mapping of the element-specificity, depth-sensitivity, and local structure on the nanoscale. It can bridge the current gap to achieve angstrom (atomic) scale resolution.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Efficient charge-carrier injection from air-stable electrodes into organic semiconductors (OSCs) is essential for fabricating solution-processed organic optoelectronic devices under ambient conditions. Today, this is typically achieved by incorporating doped OSC interlayers, introducing self-assembled dipole monolayers, or adding mobile ions to the active material (AM). Here, we demonstrate an alternative approach that eliminates the need for additional injection layers or ionic additives. We achieve this by blending the dipolar compound TMPE-OH into the electroluminescent polymer Super Yellow (SY) and depositing this sole AM between two air-stable electrodes, forming a single-layer, dipole-doped OLED (D-OLED). By tracking its transient voltage-luminance response, performing impedance spectroscopy, and comparing these characteristics with two other single-layer device concepts, i.e. a neat-SY OLED without a dipolar compound and a light-emitting electrochemical cell (LEC) containing mobile ions, we can establish that the auxiliary dipoles in the D-OLED reorient under the applied driving voltage, enabling immediate luminance turn-on and lowering the injection barriers at both electrodes. Finally, we demonstrate that the D-OLED achieves current efficacies comparable to those of SY OLEDs incorporating dedicated injection layers or LECs. Our study establishes dipolar doping as a practical strategy for efficient bipolar charge injection from air-stable electrodes in solution-processed organic semiconductor devices.

Abstract: From a symmetry perspective, ferroaxial order belongs to the same symmetry as time-reversal-even pseudovectors. Experimentally, ${\rm K_2Zr(PO_4)_2}$ is known to undergo a displacive-type phase transition from a non-ferroaxial to a ferroaxial phase. To identify the key microscopic ingredients driving this transition, we carry out a quantitative analysis combining density-functional theory calculations and symmetry-adapted closest Wannier analysis. As a result, we show that electric toroidal dipole, electric toroidal octupole, and electric hexadecapole, which belong to the same irreducible representation, make dominant contributions to the ferroaxial transition. In particular, we find that spinless electric toroidal octupoles, which originate from spin-independent off-diagonal real hopping between the $p$ orbitals on P and O atoms and between the $d$ orbitals on Zr atoms and $p$ orbitals on O atoms, provide the most significant contributions. Moreover, we explicitly analyze the orbital characters involved in the relevant hybridizations associated with these multipoles. We further show that the relativistic spin--orbit coupling has a negligible influence on the ferroaxial transition. These results demonstrate that spin-independent orbital hybridization between different orbitals on different atoms plays a crucial role in inducing the ferroaxial transition.

Abstract: Generating and controlling spin current in miniaturized magnetic quantum devices remains a central objective of spintronics, due to its potential to enable future energy-efficient information technologies. Among the existing magnetic phases, altermagnetism have recently emerged as a highly promising platform for spin current generation and control, going beyond ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. Here, we propose a symmetry-allowed spin photovoltaic effect in two-dimensional (2D) altermagnetic semiconductors that enables predictable control of giant spin injection currents. Distinct from parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$)-antiferromagnets, Janus altermagnetic semiconductors generate not only shift current but also a unique injection current with spin momentum locked in a specific direction under linearly polarized light -- a mechanism absent in $\mathcal{PT}$-antiferromagnets. Through symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we identify Janus Fe$_2$SSeO as a promising candidate. Specifically, the monolayer Fe$_2$SSeO exhibits a polarization-dependent injection conductivity reaching $\sim$1,200~$μ$A/V$^{2}\!\cdot\!\hbar/2e$, and the giant spin injection current can be effectively switched by rotating the magnetization direction and engineering strains. These findings underscore the potential of 2D altermagnets in spin photovoltaics and open avenues for innovative quantum devices.

Abstract: This study investigates the influence of varying Pt/Ru ratios on the oxidation mechanism of NiCoCrAlYTa coatings with electrodeposited, vacuum-annealed Ptsingle bondRu overlays. Weight change measurements, scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (SEM/EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used for high-temperature oxidation analyses, showing superior resistance with higher Pt contents. This was attributed to the creation of a denser, thinner, and more homogeneous layer of alumina (alpha-Al2O3) in the thermally-grown oxide (TGO) layer. On the contrary, an increase in Ru contents led to the development of other oxides and microcracks along with alumina in the TGO layer, undermining oxidation protection. The accommodation of Ti and Ta, in the minimally-deteriorative form of carbide, along with Y into the TGO layer with increasing Pt contents further enhanced oxidation resistance. In addition to the explored significant impact of the Pt/Ru ratio on oxide scale characteristics and oxidation resistance, the lower cost of Ru compared to Pt suggests the potential for designing cost-effective systems through optimized Pt/Ru ratios and microstructural engineering.

Abstract: We carry out temperature-dependent scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) studies of the charge density wave (CDW) compound ZrTe$_3$ which is intentionally doped with Hf. Previous bulk studies tie Hf doping to an enhancement of the CDW transition temperature (T$_{CDW}$). In our work, by combining STM measurements with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we observe and identify multiple defects in Zr$_{0.95}$Hf$_{0.05}$Te$_3$. Surprisingly, instead of finding clear structural or electronic signatures associated with Hf dopants, we determine the origin of the observed defects are consistent with Te and Zr vacancies. Further, our temperature dependent STM measurements allow us to examine CDW pinning to both types of observed defects below and above T$_{CDW}$.

Abstract: Platinum (Pt) and ruthenium (Ru), both members of the platinum-group metals (PGMs), are renowned for their exceptional resistance to corrosion, oxidation, and high temperatures, making them promising candidates for advanced high-temperature applications. This study investigates the direct current (DC) electrodeposition of Pt, Ru, and a binary Pt-Ru alloy onto NiCoCrAlYTa-coated single-crystal superalloy CMSX-4, along with their vacuum annealing and respective effects on the isothermal oxidation behavior of the system at 1100 °C. All the electrodeposited overlays demonstrated substantial enhancement in oxidation resistance. However, Pt exhibited the highest protection efficiency, Ru the least, and the Pt-Ru alloy provided an intermediate level of performance. Microscopic and X-ray diffraction analyses revealed that the competitive formation of protective α-Al2O3 and spinel NiAl2O4 phases on the coated surfaces played a crucial role in determining the oxidation resistance, driven by atomic interactions between the elements in the NiCoCrAlYTa bond coat and the overlay metals. Despite Ru's relatively lower oxidation resistance compared to Pt, its significantly lower cost offers potential advantages in cost-sensitive, high-temperature applications. These findings provide valuable insights into optimizing Pt-group metal coatings for durability in high-performance systems.

Abstract: Nanopores (NPs) grown by anodizing can be partially hidden beneath a relatively compact surface oxide layer, which limits the volumetric surface area of these nanostructures. In this work, nitinol (NiTi) alloy was anodized in an electrolyte containing ethylene glycol, water, and sodium chloride in static and stirred electrolyte stages with the aim of removing the irregular surface array while achieving a thick NP layer. Electron micrographs showed that anodization in the static electrolyte provides a controlled thickness of NP layers covered by an irregular surface layer. In contrast, anodizing in the stirred electrolyte reduced the thickness and the degree of irregularity, which were controlled by the different kinetics of dissolution at the tops, perimeters and bottoms of NPs. To benefit simultaneously from the thickness and regularity of the oxide layers, two-stage anodizing under static and then stirred electrolyte conditions was found to be effective. Following a 30 min anodization in the static electrolyte, anodizing for 30 min under the stirred conditions provided the highest regularity in the oxide array, resulting in NPs of almost 40 nm and 11 μm in diameter and layer thickness, respectively. Two-stage anodizing under static then stirred electrolyte conditions is proposed in order to promote NP structures for applications demanding higher surface areas.

Abstract: CrOCl is a van der Waals-layered insulator with an antiferromagnetic ground state, making it a promising platform for exfoliation and the exploration of low-dimensional magnetism. An accurate ab initio description is therefore essential. Previous density-functional studies have shown that DFT+$U$ calculations may erroneously favor ferromagnetic order depending on the choice of parametrization, an issue that cannot be remedied by simply adjusting the value of $U$. Here, we demonstrate that an explicit Hubbard correction is unnecessary: the PBE functional correctly reproduces the AFM ground state while simultaneously improving the description of structural properties. Moreover, PBE provides a reliable account of the electronic structure. These findings clarify the role of correlation effects in CrOCl and identify PBE as a robust starting point for future ab initio studies of CrOCl-based materials.

Abstract: Perovskite indoor photovoltaics (PIPVs) are emerging as a transformative technology for low-light intensity energy harvesting, owing to their high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), low-cost fabrication, solution-processability, and compositionally tunable band gaps. In this work, methylammonium-free perovskite absorbers were compositionally engineered to achieve band gaps of 1.55, 1.72, and 1.88 eV, enabling matching the spectral photoresponse with the indoor lighting. Devices based on a scalable mesoscopic n-i-p architecture were systematically evaluated under white LED illumination across correlated color temperatures (3000-5500 K) and light intensities from 250 to 1000 lux with active area of 1 cm2. The 1.72 eV composition exhibited the most promising performance across different light intensities and colors, achieving PCEs of 35.04 % at 1000 lux and 36.6 % at 250 lux, with a stable device operation of over 2000 hours. On the other hand, the 1.88 eV band-gap variant reached a peak PCE of 37.4 % under 250 lux (5500 K), however performance trade-offs were observed across the different color lights LEDs. Our combined experimental and theoretical optical-electrical simulations suggest that decreasing trap-assisted recombination in wide-bandgap compositions may further improve PIPV performance across the different illumination conditions. In contrast, devices with 1.55 eV band gap underperformed in such conditions due to suboptimal spectral overlap and utilization. These findings establish bandgap optimization and device architecture as key design principles for high-efficiency, stable PIPVs, advancing their integration into self-powered electronic systems and innovative indoor environments.

Abstract: Controlled crystallization of amorphous alloys offers a powerful route to tailor magnetic and structural properties at the nanoscale. Thin films of CoFeB alloy are essential for the development of various spintronic devices. The crystallization mechanisms of CoFeB during the annealing process have been thoroughly investigated in earlier studies, demonstrating that boron diffuses from the amorphous film, allowing the remaining CoFe to form a body-centered cubic lattice. Here, a distinct transformation pathway in pulsed-laser-deposited amorphous Co40Fe40B20 films is revealed, where vacuum annealing drives the formation of a metastable tau-boride phase, (Co,Fe)23B6. Comprehensive structural characterization - combining X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and compositional analysis - proves that tau-boride forms with high crystalline quality and minimal boron loss. Following the transition from amorphous CoFeB films to crystalline (Co,Fe)23B6, an improvement of magnetic properties is observed, with corresponding increases in such values as saturation magnetization, coercivity, loop squareness, and average magnetic moment. The reproducible stabilization of a boron-rich metastable phase in CoFeB thin films expands the known crystallization landscape of this technologically important alloy system. These findings provide new insight into phase engineering in transition-metal borides and open opportunities for designing nanostructured magnetic materials with tunable functionality for next-generation spintronic and nanoelectronic devices.

Abstract: When the dimensions of structures shrink to the order of the inelastic mean free path of the energy-carrying quasi-particles, the character of energy transport changes from diffusive to ballistic. However, the point of transition remains a matter of debate. Here, we determine the dominant channel of energy transport through a nanoscale Cu layer as a function of its thickness. The energy rapidly transferred across Cu via hot electrons from a photo-excited Pt layer into a buried Ni detection layer translates into a rapid expansion of the Ni layer probed via ultrafast x-ray diffraction. The non-linear dependence of the Ni strain amplitude on the absorbed laser fluence indicates that the transport through Cu becomes more efficient with increasing fluence. This fluence-dependent transport efficiency is reproduced by a diffusive energy transport model and serves as a generally applicable experimental approach to distinguish diffusion from ballistic transport. Following this approach, we identify diffusive electronic energy transport to govern the spatial energy distribution for Cu layer thicknesses larger than twice the electronic inelastic mean free path.

Abstract: We establish a quantitative relation between the altermagnetic spin-splitting and different higher order multipoles of the charge and magnetization density around the magnetic atoms. Magnetic multipoles such as octupoles or triakontadipoles have been suggested as potential ferroic order parameters for d- and g-wave altermagnetism, respectively, based mainly on qualitative symmetry arguments. We use first-principles-based electronic structure calculations to establish a clear quantitative relation between the strength of the altermagnetic spin splitting and the magnitude of certain local multipoles. We vary the magnitude of these multipoles either by applying an appropriate constraint on the charge density or by varying a corresponding structural distortion mode, using two simple perovskite materials, SrCrO3 and LaVO3, as model systems. Our analysis indicates that in general the altermagnetic spin splitting is not exclusively determined by the lowest order nonzero magnetic multipole, but results from a superposition of contributions from different multipoles with comparable strength, suggesting the need for a multi-component order parameter to describe altermagnetism. We also discuss different measures to quantify the overall spin-splitting of a material, without relying on features that might be specific to only individual bands.

Abstract: A precise detection of palladium (Pd) ions is a critical challenge with significant socio-economic implications across various industrial and chemical sectors. Due to its widespread use and poor biodegradability, Pd2+ accumulates in environmental ecosystems, posing severe risks to both the environment and living organisms. Consequently, there is a strong demand for selective, sensitive, and user-friendly detection methods. Among emerging strategies, optical detection techniques (both luminescent and colorimetric) using metal-based receptors have gained considerable attention. These sensors offer distinct advantages over traditional organic probes, including large Stokes shifts, long emission lifetimes, exceptional photostability, enhanced water solubility, recyclability, and remarkable chemical versatility. These attributes make them highly suitable for diverse applications in sensing and bioanalytical fields. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in luminescent and colorimetric metal-based probes, including metal complexes and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), for the selective detection of Pd2+. It discusses key design strategies, critical performance factors, and future prospects, offering valuable insights for researchers working on next-generation sensing platform.

Abstract: Summarized abstract- Gallium nanoparticles (Ga-NPs) display tunable plasmonic resonances from the ultraviolet to the infrared, but achieving uniform and ordered Ga-NP arrays is hindered by coarsening-induced size dispersion during physical deposition. Here, the effect of substrate temperature on nucleation, growth, and homogenization of Ga-NPs thermally evaporated on GaAs is systematically analyzed using atomic force and scanning electron microscopies. An optimal 300-350 celsius degrees window yields narrowly dispersed, dense arrays, whereas higher temperatures enhance surface diffusion and desorption, producing larger, sparser, and morphologically relaxed (flattened) NPs. Temperature-dependent optical reflectance reveals localized surface plasmon resonances whose energies scale with NP size and aspect ratio, and a figure of merit combining density and size dispersion identifies intermediate temperatures as optimal, in agreement with increased plasmonic quality factors. In-situ post-deposition annealing demonstrates Ostwald ripening as the dominant high-temperature coarsening pathway and underscores the need for rapid cooling and oxide-shell stabilization to preserve homogeneity. Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy and electron energy-loss spectroscopy confirm a core-shell architecture, quantify temperature-driven oxide thickening, and verify the liquid-metal nature of the Ga NPs core. Finally, extended deposition tests show that temperature-driven size homogenization persists for larger NPs, establishing a general framework for thermal control of uniformity and optical performance in Ga-NP arrays suitable for plasmonic devices.

Abstract: The $LnMn_{6}Sn_{6}$ family of materials, where $Ln^{3+}$ is a lanthanide trivalent cation, have attracted extensive interest due to the interplay of electronic structure, magnetism, and topology present in this family that gives rise to complex electronic and magnetic phenomena. Specifically, the crystal field effects on the lanthanide ion and crystal field splitting of otherwise degenerate energy levels causes dramatic changes in the orbital magnetic behavior and overall magnetic structure of these materials. The coupling of the highly anisotropic lanthanide ions' spins (with large spin-orbit couplings) to the spins of the Mn atoms, which are arrayed in a kagome lattice, engenders exotic topological phenomena. This combination of magnetic anisotropy and electronic topology motivates investigation into the magnetic excitations of these materials, which unlike the ground state magnetic structures of this family, have not been extensively studied. Herein, we use Brillouin light scattering to measure the magnon spectra of $LnMn_{6}Sn_{6}$ (Ln = Tb, Dy, and Ho). This work represents the first detailed and comparative study on the magnetic dynamics in these materials and reveals that the identity of the lanthanide ion strongly influences the magnon frequency and demonstrates a direct correlation between the lanthanide's magnetic anisotropy and the observed spin wave excitations. Quantitative analysis indicates that the lanthanide ion's anisotropy controls the magnon frequency, while its total angular momentum influences the material's gyromagnetic ratio. These findings suggest that lanthanide substitution provides a pathway for tuning magnon properties in this material family.

Abstract: We develop highly corrosion-resistant and conductive Ti-Nb-O coatings for metallic components -- bipolar plates (BPPs) and porous transport layers (PTLs) -- in PEM water electrolyzers. Using reactive high-power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS), we deposit compact 200 nm bilayer coatings onto SS316L substrates, systematically tailoring their composition. By precisely controlling oxygen partial pressure and Nb/Ti ratio, we adjust stoichiometry and structure, directly affecting electrical resistivity and corrosion resistance. We examine interfacial contact resistance (ICR) and electrochemical parameters before and after accelerated corrosion testing. Optimized coatings exhibit resistivity on the order of 10^-4 Ohmcm and extremely low corrosion current densities (J_corr = 0.01-0.08 uA/cm^2), well below the U.S. DOE 2026 target. Most importantly, these coatings enable the ICR target after accelerated corrosion testing with a Pt overlayer as thin as 5 nm, reducing Pt loading by up to two orders of magnitude compared to conventional approaches.

Abstract: Donor-$π$-acceptor (D-$π$-A) functionalization of MOF linkers can enhance visible-light photocatalytic activity, yet the mechanisms responsible for these effects remain unclear. Here we combine EPR spectroscopy, transient photoluminescence, and first-principles calculations to examine how diazo-coupled anisole, diphenylamine (DPA), and N,N-dimethylaniline (NNDMA) groups modify the photophysics of UiO-66-NH$_2$. All donor units introduce new occupied states near the valence-band edge, enabling charge separation through dye-to-framework electron transfer. Among them, the anisole-modified material stands out for facilitating efficient intersystem crossing into a triplet charge-transfer configuration that suppresses fast recombination and yields long-lived charge carriers detectable by photo-EPR. Meanwhile, bulkier donors such as DPA and NNDMA - despite their stronger electron-donating character - also tend to introduce defect-associated trap states. These results underscore the interplay between donor-induced electronic-structure changes, triplet pathways, and defect-mediated recombination, offering a mechanistic basis for tuning photocatalytic response in D-$π$-A-modified MOFs.

Abstract: Temperature-dependent transport data, including diffusion coefficients and ionic conductivities, are routinely analysed by fitting empirical models such as the Arrhenius equation. These fitted models yield parameters such as the activation energy, and can be used to extrapolate to temperatures outside the measured range. Researchers frequently face challenges in this analysis: quantifying the uncertainty of fitted parameters, assessing whether the data quality is sufficient to support a particular empirical model, and using these models to predict behaviour at extrapolated temperatures. Bayesian methods offer a coherent framework that addresses all of these challenges. This tutorial introduces the use of Bayesian methods for analysing temperature-dependent transport data, covering parameter estimation, model selection, and extrapolation with uncertainty propagation, with illustrative examples from molecular dynamics simulations of superionic materials.

Abstract: Materials performance is deeply linked to their microstructures, which govern key properties such as strength, durability, and fatigue resistance. EBSD is a major technique for characterizing these microstructures, but acquiring large and statistically representative EBSD maps remains slow, costly, and often limited to small regions. In this work, we introduce InfinityEBSD, a diffusion-based method for generating monophase realistic EBSD maps of arbitrary size, conditioned on physically meaningful microstructural metrics. This approach supports two primary use cases: extending small experimental EBSD maps to arbitrary sizes, and generating entirely new maps directly from statistical descriptors, without any input map. Conditioning is achieved through eight microstructural descriptors, including grain size, grain perimeter, grain inertia ratio, coordination number and disorientation angle distribution, allowing the model to generate maps that are both visually realistic and physically interpretable. A patch-wise geometric extension strategy ensures spatial continuity across grains, enabling the model to produce large-scale EBSD maps while maintaining coherent grain boundaries and orientation transitions. The generated maps can also be exported as valid Channel Text Files (CTF) for immediate post-processing and analysis in software such as MTEX or simulation environments like DIGIMU. We quantitatively validate our results by comparing distributions of the guiding metrics before and after generation, showing that the model respects the statistical targets while introducing morphological diversity. InfinityEBSD demonstrates that diffusion models, guided by physical metrics, can bridge the gap between synthetic and realistic materials representation, paving the way for future developments such as 3D realistic microstructure generation from 2D data.

Abstract: Understanding the fundamental properties that dictate photoexcited polarons in materials is critical to tuning their properties. Theoretical models of polarons have only recently been extended to the excited state. Experimental measurements of polaron formation and transport have been widely undertaken across a range of materials, from photocatalysts and superconductors to soft conducting polymers. Here, we map experimental measurements of quantities such as polaron strength onto phase diagrams of the Holstein, Hubbard-Holstein, and t-J-Holstein models. This work demonstrates that tuning electron-phonon coupling strength, electron localization, and spin exchange can be leveraged to suppress or control polaron formation in transition metal oxides. We find that the t-J-Holstein model best describes the measured iron oxides and could be generally applied to a wide range of systems that exhibit polaron formation in the excited state. This work combines experimental data with ground state models to provide a robust parameter space for informing photoexcited polaron design.

Abstract: We report the experimental discovery of bulk superconductivity in two kagome lattice compounds, YRu$_3$B$_2$ and LuRu$_3$B$_2$, which were predicted through machine learning-accelerated high-throughput screening combined with first principles calculations. These materials crystallize in the hexagonal CeCo$_3$B$_2$-type structure with planar kagome networks formed by Ru atoms. We observe superconducting critical temperatures of $T_{c} = 0.81$~K for YRu$_3$B$_2$ and $T_{c} = 0.95$~K for LuRu$_3$B$_2$, confirmed through magnetization and specific heat measurements. Both compounds exhibit nearly 100\% superconducting volume fractions, demonstrating bulk superconductivity. Compared with LaRu$_3$Si$_2$, YRu$_3$B$_2$ and LuRu$_3$B$_2$ show a more dispersive Ru local $d_{x^2-y^2}$ quasi-flat band (and thus a reduced DOS at $E_F$) together with an overall hardening of the phonon spectrum, both of which lower the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) constant $λ$. Meanwhile, the dominant real-space EPC between Ru local $d_{x^2-y^2}$ states and the low-frequency Ru in-plane local $x$ branch remains nearly unchanged, indicating that the reduction of $λ$ originates from the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ DOS reduction and the overall phonon hardening. Superfluid weight calculations show that conventional contributions dominate over quantum geometric effects due to the dispersive nature of bands near the Fermi level. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating machine learning screening, first principles theory, and experimental synthesis for accelerating the discovery of new superconducting materials.

Abstract: Josephson junctions (JJs), devices consisting of two superconductors separated by a barrier, are of great technological importance, being a cornerstone of quantum information processing. Classical understanding of superconductor-insulator-superconductor JJs is that conventional insulator's properties, other than magnetism, do not significantly influence the junction's behavior. However, recent work on quantum material (QM) JJs - using Mott insulator Nb3Br8 - resulted in magnetic field-free non-reciprocal superconductivity, termed the Josephson diode effect (JDE), implying the QM's intrinsic properties can modulate superconductivity in non-trivial ways. To date, the underlying mechanism and dependence of the JDE on correlation strength (U/t) has not been elucidated. Here we fabricate QMJJs using correlated Kagome insulators with varying U/t, Nb3X8 (X=Cl, Br, I), observing a decreasing trend of the field-free JDE with Nb3Cl8 reaching ~48% efficiency, Nb3Br8 ~6%, and Nb3I8 having no discernible JDE, matching the trend of decreasing U/t from Cl to I and suggesting correlation in insulators drives the field-free JDE.

Abstract: Superconductivity with non-trivial band topology provides a novel platform for exploring topological superconductivity and its quantum applications. A detailed microscopic understanding of the superconducting ground state in such materials is crucial. Here, we report the results of a muon spin rotation/relaxation study ($μ$SR) of the topologically non-trivial superconductor SnAs, which exhibits superconductivity below 3.74(1) \si{K}. Zero-field (ZF) $μ$SR data reveal that this system is a time-reversal invariant superconductor, and systematic transverse-field (TF) $μ$SR measurements unveil the type-I nature of the SnAs superconductor. We have established the superconducting phase diagram to understand the intermediate state of type-I superconductors. Moreover, ab \textit{initio} band structure and phonon calculations are performed, which correlate with the experimental characterization.

Abstract: We report the superconducting gap in the van der Waals layered quasicrystal Cu-doped Ta$_{1.6}$Te, using a fast relaxation technique that removes the large nuclear contribution of $^{181}$Ta.
  The initial-slope method enabled detection of the electronic specific heat down to 60~mK, revealing a fully gapped state with $Δ(0)/k_{\rm B} = 1.43$~K.
  Both the gap magnitude and specific-heat jump are smaller than BCS predictions, while quasiparticle excitations are strongly suppressed, consistent with a theoretical expectation for aperiodic systems.
  AC-susceptibility measurements show a large upper critical field and pronounced anisotropy, reflecting the quasi-two-dimensional structure.
  These results provide the first thermodynamic evidence for a full-gap superconducting state in a quasicrystal and highlight unconventional pairing mechanisms beyond periodic lattices.

Abstract: The realization of ambient-pressure superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films raises a fundamental question: is the metallic ground state driven by lattice strain or interfacial charge reconstruction? Using fully self-consistent DFT+$U$ calculations on La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$/SrLaAlO$_4$ heterostructures, we identify that intrinsic hole doping via interfacial Sr interdiffusion is the decisive factor in stabilizing the metallic state. Our 1-unit-cell model accurately reproduces the ARPES-observed Fermi surface, particularly the critical Ni-$d_{z^2}$ derived $γ$ hole pocket, which originates exclusively from the interface-proximal bilayer. Furthermore, comparative tight-binding analysis suggests that the reduced superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) in thin films stems from the synergistic suppression of the electronic density of states (DOS) and vertical superexchange coupling ($J \perp Z$). These findings highlight that interface engineering plays a critical role beyond simple strain imposition in modulating nickelate orbital physics.

Abstract: We report bulk ultrasound measurements up to 80 T and down to 0.5 K of the field re-entrant superconducting phase of the unconventional superconductor UTe$_2$. Clear bulk signatures of superconductivity are observed in the longitudinal elastic mode $c_{11}$ for fields applied at a tilt angle of $θ_{b-c} =30^\circ$ from $b$-axis. We confirm an upper critical field of $H_{\rm c2}\approx65$ T at 0.5 K and bulk superconductivity which survives up to $T\approx 2$ K for fields above the metamagnetic transition. The $c_{11}$ mode has propagation and displacement vectors along the $a$-axis, and for fields applied at a tilt angle of $θ_{b-c} =30^\circ$, this mode is sensitive to the elasticity of the vortex lattice. The anomalies observed in $c_{11}$ are in part reminiscent of superconducting vortices pinned to lattice defects. Nonetheless, an excess attenuation, with respect to the normal state, is observed throughout the entire superconducting phase, suggesting unusual vortex dynamics and pinning in the field re-entrant superconducting phase of UTe$_2$.

Abstract: The standard mean-field treatment of low-temperature superconductors leads to a square-root divergent density of states at the gap value. This feature can lead to unphysical logarithmic divergences in various quantities, such as currents and qubit transition rates. We revisit their possible regularization based on the proximity effect between two superconducting films with different gaps. We derive analytical approximations for the density of states in each superconducting film. We find that the smearing of the density of states grows with the gap asymmetry. As a concrete example, we discuss the regularization of transition rates in qubits with frequency close to resonance with the gap asymmetry between the two films, and the consequent smoothening of the jump discontinuity in the qubit frequency shift.

Abstract: We discuss the quantum geometric contribution to the diffusion constant and the DC conductivity in metals and semimetals with linear Dirac dispersion. We demonstrate that, for systems with perfectly linear dispersion, there exists a clear and rigorous separation of the quantum geometric from the ordinary band velocity contributions to the diffusion constant, which turns out to be directly related to the separation of a rank two tensor into transverse and longitudinal parts. We also demonstrate that the diffusion constant of three-dimensional Dirac fermions at charge neutrality is entirely quantum geometric in origin, which is not the case for two-dimensional Dirac fermions. This is the result of an accidental perfect cancellation of the band velocity contribution in three dimensions.

Abstract: Recently, a host of exotic magnetic textures such as topologically protected skyrmion lattices has been discovered in several bulk metallic lanthanide compounds. In addition to hosting skyrmion phases, a hallmark of this class of materials is the appearance of numerous spin textures characterized by a superposition of multi-$q$ magnetic modulations: spin moiré superlattices. The nuanced energy landscape thus motivates detailed studies to understand the underlying interactions. Here, we comprehensively characterize and model the three zero-field magnetic textures present in one such material, EuAg$_4$Sb$_2$. Systematic symmetry breaking experiments using magnetic field and strain determine that the ground state incommensurate magnetic phase (ICM1) is single-$q$. In contrast, ICM2 and ICM3 are both double-$q$, \textit{i.e.}, spin moiré superlattices. Further, through application of polarized small angle neutron scattering and spherical neutron polarimetry, we demonstrate that ICM1 is a single-$q$ cycloid and ICM2 and ICM3 are double-$q$ vortex lattices, with Eu moments lying in the $ab$-plane in zero field and with a ferromagnetic component at finite field. Despite the quasi-2D nature of EuAg$_4$Sb$_2$, the modulations propagate out of the \textit{ab}-plane, leading to a shift of the spin texture between triangle lattice planes. Further, the ICM3 to ICM2 transition includes an unusual 45$^\circ$ rotation of the magnetic vortex lattice. Motivated by the coexistence of such drastically different phases in this compound, we conclude by developing a phenomenological model to understand the stability of these states. Our experimental probes and theoretical modeling definitively characterize three different and tunable phases in one material, and provide insight for the design of new topological spin-texture materials.

Abstract: Jackiw-Rebbi zero modes were first proposed in 1976 as topologically protected zero-energy states localized at domain walls in one-dimensional Dirac systems. They have attracted widespread attention in the field of topological quantum computing, as they serve as non-superconducting analogs of Majorana zero modes and support non-Abelian statistics in topological insulator systems. %In the braiding process of the Jackiw-Rebbi zero modes, their braiding properties are closely related to the strength of disorder. However, compared to their Majorana cousins, the braiding properties of Jackiw-Rebbi zero modes are vulnerable to the on-site energy deviation between the modes involved in the experiment. In this work, we propose to estimate the braiding properties of Jackiw-Rebbi zero-modes through measurements of transport signatures, which are readily measurable in current experiments. We find that the fidelity of braiding operation reaches unity when the current noise is fully suppressed, while this braiding fidelity monotonously decreases with the increasing of the current noise. Based on these transport signatures, we further discuss the correspondence between Majorana and Jackiw-Rebbi zero modes, highlighting their similarity in supporting non-Abelian statistics.

Abstract: We study the formation of topological defects via the Kibble-Zurek mechanism in a polariton supersolid in a liquid crystal microcavity with tunable Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling. We predict analytically two different scalings in the slow- and fast-quench regimes, and confirm these predictions numerically. We also present experimental results for the slow-quench regime, demonstrating an original Kibble-Zurek scaling exponent $η_{KZM}=1.0\pm 0.2$

Abstract: We present a theoretical investigation of the emergence of chiral topological superconductivity in small-angle twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) and twisted double bilayer graphene (tDBLG). Using the low-energy continuum model and incorporating spin-triplet $p_{x}+i p_{y}$ pairing in each graphene layer, we construct the effective models for both tBLG and tDBLG with superconductivity. By varying the chemical potential, superconducting order parameter, and twist angle, we explore the emergence of topological superconducting phases via the calculation of Chern numbers. Our phase diagrams for tBLG and tDBLG (both AB-AB and AB-BA stackings) reveal distinct topological transitions, which are consistently marked by bulk gap-closing points. To gain further insight, we analyze the evolution of Chern numbers by tracking the number and location of gap closings within the moiré Brillouin zone. Additionally, we illustrate representative squared amplitude of Bloch states corresponding to different topological phases. In the later part of our study, the effect of trigonal warping on the topological superconducting properties is also discussed. Beyond the quantitative results, our study highlights how the interplay between moiré band structure and unconventional pairing symmetries enriches the landscape of possible superconducting states in twisted graphene systems. The framework developed here may also be extended to other multilayer moiré materials, offering a route towards engineering exotic topological superconductivity with tunable parameters.

Abstract: The spin Hall effect in a heavy metal intercorrelates an AC electric current to the magnetization dynamics in an adjacent ferromagnet, which manifests as an electric reactance in the system's current-voltage response. We present a comprehensive theoretical analysis for this emergent reactance contribution in the frequency regime relevant to transport measurements up to a few GHz. Our analysis reveals that the reactance becomes inductor-like at low frequency below the ferromagnetic resonance. Crucially, we find that the sign of the reactance is directly governed by the spin transfer mechanism at the interface, which depends on the competition between its damping-like and field-like components parametrized by the spin mixing conductance. This characteristic behavior in the reactance offers a powerful transport observable in distinguishing the interfacial spin transfer processes in spintronic materials.

Abstract: The injection, propagation and detection of spin currents are essential physical processes in spintronics. So far, the separation of charge and spin currents was facilitated by the electrical spin injection from a ferromagnet (FM) or the injection by a relativistic spin Hall effect. The devices employed are lateral spin valves comprising spatially separated injection and detection electrodes, connected by a spin-propagation channel. The time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking FM spin injection is realized in a geometry with an electrical bias applied between the injection electrode and the channel and is modelled by a conserved spin-polarized drift current. In contrast, the spin injection by the T-symmetric relativistic spin Hall mechanism is driven by an electrical bias applied across the injection electrode alone, and is modelled by a non-conserved spin current transverse to the applied bias. In this work, we use a lateral spin valve with a Mn5Si3 injection electrode to directly demonstrate a TRS-breaking spin injection from a compensated magnet with a vanishing net magnetization. Specifically, the TRS-breaking is demonstrated by the fact that switching between time-reversed states of the compensated magnet changes the detected spin signal. Moreover, the TRS-breaking nature of the spin injection is observed in both experimental geometries with the different electrical biasing, while using the same detection electrode. We show that this unconventional spin-injection is consistent with different magnitudes and propagation angles of electrical currents in the spin-up and spin-down channel in a d-wave altermagnet. Here our symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations are based on the compensated collinear altermagnetic order which has provided a comprehensive microscopic interpretation of earlier structural, magnetic, and anomalous Hall and Nernst measurements in Mn5Si3 thin films.

Abstract: We study how topological crystalline defects--dislocations--reshape the real-space quantum geometric tensor and act as tunable sources of quantum geometry. We show that dislocations strongly enhance the quantum metric, establishing a direct link between lattice topology and the Hilbert-space geometry of states. We characterize the quantum geometry of topological magnons in ordered arrays of dislocations, demonstrating that defect-induced geometric enhancement controls their localization and topological protection. In disordered arrays, dislocation-driven geometry expands the accessible topological phase space and enables transitions to disorder-induced topological phases. Our results identify the quantum metric as a tunable bridge between crystalline topology, magnonic excitations, and emergent topological matter in aperiodic solid-state and synthetic systems.

Abstract: Recent progress in constructing supramolecular assemblies with hierarchical chirality offers new opportunities to investigate the chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect and its potential applications. In this work, we systematically examine the CISS effect in such multichiral systems by designing a class of multilayer helical architectures constructed of stacked and interfaced individual helical rings, each possessing well-defined local chirality. Through controlled interlayer twisting, a global helical handedness is further imposed, forming a multichiral tubular helix. Theoretical calculations reveal that these two distinct chiral hierarchies lead to several unprecedented CISS phenomena, such as enhanced spin polarization arising from cooperative dual chirality, along with the simultaneous emergence of transverse and longitudinal CISS signals. Moreover, interlayer torsional competition modulates the system's response to external fields. The dual-chiral geometry breaks the conventional symmetry of single helices, inducing an anomalous angular phase shift in magnetoresistance. Furthermore, Floquet analysis reveals that the interplay between local and global chirality enables controlled spin polarization switching under circularly polarized light. These findings provide a basic theoretical framework for studying the CISS in multichiral superstructures and establish design principles for coupled optical, magnetic, and spin manipulations, thereby facilitating the development of multichiral spintronic devices.

Abstract: Ultrashort laser pulses provide the fastest known way to switch magnetic order. Such excitation commonly creates nanometer-scale domains, even after homogeneous illumination when the position of nucleated domains is not externally defined. However, the physics of domain localization during such ultrafast phase transitions remains unresolved. Here, we use shot-resolved pump-probe resonant x-ray scattering together with a material featuring a periodically modulated magnetic anisotropy landscape to track, in real time, the laser-driven nucleation and localization of nanometer-scale spin textures. We find that nucleation and localization are two distinct processes. Nucleation occurs homogeneously via fluctuations at early times, whereas spatially periodic structures emerge only later and, under suitable conditions, localize in less than one nanosecond. Real-space simulations show that this localization is governed by strong lateral variations in spin-texture lifetimes. Our results demonstrate that ultrafast phase-transition dynamics fundamentally differ from conventional transitions, yet still can be controlled through moderate nanometer-scale tailoring of the energy landscape.

Abstract: Symmetry and topology are essential principles in topological physics. Recently, the idea of sub-symmetry-protected topology -- where some of the original symmetries are broken while a remaining subset, called sub-symmetries, continues to protect specific boundary states -- has been developed. Here, we extend sub-symmetry-protected topology to higher-order topological systems from second-order topological insulators to semimetals. By introducing a sub-symmetry-protecting perturbation that acts on a single sublattice and selectively preserves specific topological boundary states, we track the evolution of these states and their topological features using numerical and analytical methods, and we show that state-resolved quadrupole moments diagnose which corner or hinge modes remain topological. As a representative example of a second-order topological insulator, we begin with the Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes model. We demonstrate that, under a sub-symmetry-protecting perturbation, sub-symmetry-protected corner states remain pinned at zero energy and maintain quantized state-resolved quadrupole moments. In contrast, corner states on sub-symmetry-broken boundaries shift away from zero energy and lose their quantized character. We further extend this framework to a three-dimensional second-order topological semimetal, constructed by stacking second-order topological insulator layers, and analyze how second-order Fermi arc states -- hinge-localized modes that link the projections of bulk Dirac points, in contrast to conventional surface Fermi arcs -- evolve under a sub-symmetry-protecting perturbation. While one second-order Fermi arc becomes dispersive and loses its quadrupolar character under a sub-symmetry-breaking perturbation, the remaining second-order Fermi arcs retain chiral symmetry and preserve quantized quadrupolar characters.

Abstract: Structure and morphology play a crucial role in enhancing the biomimetic oxidase activity of nanozymes. In this study, a facile \emph{in situ} chemical oxidation strategy was employed to synthesize MOF-derived MnO$_x$, utilizing the structural features of the parent MOF to enhance oxidase-mimicking activity. We systematically investigated the effects of phase evolution, structural modulation, and morphology on the oxidase activity of MnO$_x$ with Fe substitution. The oxidase-like activity was evaluated using the chromogenic substrate 3,3$'$,5,5$'$-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), which produced a blue-colored oxidized TMB (ox-TMB) with an absorption peak at 652~nm upon oxidation. While all Fe-doped MnO$_x$ nanostructures exhibited oxidase-like activity, the 10\% Fe-doped sample (10Fe-MnO$_x$) demonstrated the highest performance, likely due to a synergistic effect of structure, morphology, and the presence of oxygen vacancies. The underlying oxidase mechanism was investigated using steady-state kinetics and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis. In addition, a colorimetric assay was developed for the detection of Hg$^{2+}$ and hydroquinone (HQ) in real water samples collected from industrial and natural sources. The calculated detection limits of the 10Fe-MnO$_x$ colorimetric probe for HQ (1.74~$μ$M) and Hg$^{2+}$ (0.47~$μ$M) outperformed those of conventional metal oxide-based nanozymes. These findings pave the way for the development of easily synthesizable, scalable, and highly sensitive oxidase-based MOF-derived metal oxide nanomaterials with significant potential in biological and environmental applications.

Abstract: Dissipative coupling refers to the effect where two systems interact with each other mediated by dissipation channels. Recent advances in controlling light-matter systems have opened new avenues to explore non-Hermitian effects arising from dissipative coupling, such as level attraction and anomalous dispersions. In this work, we perform a parametric study of these effects in a polariton system, i.e., a light-matter superposition, under both dissipative and coherent coupling. We characterize the effects of different sources of non-Hermitian behavior and analytically identify the conditions for the emergence of negative effective mass, exceptional points, and bound states in the continuum as a function of the light-matter detuning, the coherent-to-dissipative coupling ratio, and the relative decay rate of the non-interacting subsystems. We also analyze the classical limit of the polariton system within a non-Hermitian framework, employing coherent states.

Abstract: Synthetic antiferromagnetic (SAF) skyrmions are nanoscale composite textures that exhibit high-speed, Hall-free current-driven motion and recently demonstrated self-propulsion. These remarkable properties rely on the stability of the SAF skyrmion's topological bound state, whose underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, using an atomistic spin model, we analyze the collapse pathways of bilayer SAF skyrmions in homochiral systems, where both ferromagnetic layers share the same Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) vectors, and in heterochiral systems, where the DMI vectors have opposite directions. We find that pair destruction occurs either by decoupling or by sequential collapse into the homogeneous antiferromagnetic state, so the activation energy is set by the smaller of these two barriers. By examining how these barriers vary with DMI strength, anisotropy, magnetic field, and interlayer exchange, we identify regimes of enhanced stability. In particular, increasing interlayer coupling strengthens homochiral skyrmions but weakens heterochiral ones, while reducing the anisotropy constant effectively stabilizes heterochiral SAF skyrmions. These results outline viable strategies to optimize SAF heterostructures for enhanced skyrmion stability in racetrack devices and emerging active skyrmionic systems.
