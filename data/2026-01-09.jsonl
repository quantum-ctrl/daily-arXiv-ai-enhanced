While an established graphical user interface (GUI) exists for simulation setup and execution, efficient post-processing, comparison of multiple simulations, and preparation of specific input file parameters remain limited. In this work, we present a web-based interface (sdtrimsp.streamlit.app) that complements existing SDTrimSP tools by focusing on interactive visualization and analysis of depth distribution profiles. The platform enables direct upload and comparison of static and fluence-dependent dynamic profiles, supports unit conversion, and provides an integrated calculator for determining the adjustable atomic density parameter of implanted ions required in dynamic simulations. In addition, the interface offers automated conversion of standard crystallographic file formats into the SDTrimSP-specific crystal structure input format for simulations into crystalline targets. The capabilities of the interface are demonstrated for nitrogen ion implantation into vanadium, including amorphous static and dynamic simulations and static crystalline simulations for different surface orientations. The results illustrate fluence-dependent saturation effects as well as orientation-dependent ion channeling behavior. Overall, the presented web-based tool provides a convenient and flexible extension to existing SDTrimSP workflows."}

Recently, the promising room-temperature spin centre named ST1 was identified as an oxygen centre, but of still unknown atomic structure and thermal stability. In this work, we report on the optically active oxygen-related centres and the conditions for their formation, using ion implantation of oxygen in various conditions of depth and fluence. More specifically, we establish the temperature formation/stability range of the ST1 centre, which has a maximum at about 1100°C and is narrower than for NV centres. In these conditions, optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) on small ST1 ensembles was measured with a spin readout contrast of > 20% at 300K. In cathodoluminescence, the 535 nm ST1 peak is not observed. Besides, a broad peak centred at 460 nm is measured for implantation of O$_2$ molecular ions. For an annealing temperature of 1500°C, a different centre is formed (with ZPL at 584.5 nm) with an intensity increasing with a power law 1.5 < p < 1.9 dependence from the implantation fluence. This suggests that this centre contains two oxygen atoms. Besides, a new spectral feature associated to an intrinsic defect was also observed, with four prominent lines (especially at 594nm). Finally, the thermal formation and stability of oxygen centres in diamond presented here are important for the identification of the atomic structure of defects such as the ST1 and possible O$_2$V$_x$ complex by means of ab initio calculations. Indeed, the formation energies and charge states of defect centres are easier to compute than the full energy level scheme, which to date still remains unsuccessful regarding the ST1 centre."}

This limitation is critical for buffer layer graphene, a semiconducting interfacial phase, whose vibrational signatures are overlapped with the SiC background and challenging to be reliably accessed using conventional reference-based subtraction, due to strong spatial and experimental variability of the substrate signal. Here we present SpectraFormer, a transformer-based deep learning model that reconstructs the SiC Raman substrate contribution directly from post-growth partially masked spectroscopic data without relying on explicit reference measurements. By learning global correlations across the entire Raman shift range, the model captures the statistical structure of the SiC background and enables accurate reconstruction of its contribution in mixed spectra. Subtraction of the reconstructed substrate signal reveals weak vibrational features associated with ZLG that are inaccessible through conventional analysis methods. The extracted spectra are validated by ab initio vibrational calculations, allowing assignment of the resolved features to specific modes and confirming their physical consistency. By leveraging a state-of-the-art attention-based deep learning architecture, this approach establishes a robust, reference-free framework for Raman analysis of graphene on SiC and provides a foundation, compatible with real-time data acquisition, to its integration into automated, closed-loop AI-assisted growth optimization."}

This allows us to compute the optical conductivity tensor. We identify essential conditions required for a nonzero longitudinal conductivity at finite frequencies in a disorder-free and translationally invariant system. Specifically, this is neither related to impurity scattering nor electron-phonon interaction, but derives indirectly from the multicomponent character of the incipient superconducting order and the parent metallic state. Under these conditions, the enhancement of the DC conductivity due to fluctuations close to the critical point follows the same critical behaviour as in the diffusive limit."}

By analyzing these dynamics on a single-curve, single-pixel basis, we extract time-local mechanical information without external broadband excitation or multi-pass imaging. We develop a state-dependent single-mode harmonic oscillator model that captures snap-in excitation, hydration-mediated dissipation, and contact stiffness during fast force mapping. Experimental analysis of high-bandwidth force-curve data and numerical simulations demonstrate that multiple dynamically distinct interaction regimes occur within a single FC. Accessing these transient dynamics enables high-throughput, high-resolution mapping of mechanical contrast and reveals heterogeneous and non-repeatable behaviors that are lost under conventional averaging or with conventional detection schemes with higher noise floors."}

This is because of the ease that the tests afford in both the preparation of the specimen (a beam of rectangular cross section) and the application of the loads (simple supports pressing on the specimen). Yet, this practical advantage has to be tempered by the fact that the observations from both of these tests -- being \\emph{indirect} experiments in the sense that they involve \\emph{not} uniform uniaxial tension but non-uniform triaxial stress states throughout the specimen -- have to be appropriately interpreted to be useful. By making use of the phase-field fracture theory initiated by Kumar, Francfort, and Lopez-Pamies (2018), which has been recently established as a complete theory of fracture capable of accurately describing the nucleation and propagation of cracks in elastic brittle materials under arbitrary quasistatic loading conditions, the main objective of this paper is to carry out a thorough 3D quantitative analysis of when and where fracture nucleates and propagates in four-point and three-point bending tests and thereby establish how to appropriately interpret their results. As a corollary, the analysis provides an explanation for why four-point bending tests typically yield smaller flexural strengths than three-point bending tests, a source of constant headaches for practitioners who have been left to wonder which test -- if any -- would be more appropriate for their purposes."}

The FPL family improves circuit performance by employing various Josephson junction (JJ) structures, including high-$J_c$ self-shunted 0-JJ stacks, $π$-JJs, and 0/$π$-JJ stacks. FPL utilizes 0- and $π$-JJs to replace the bulky geometric inductors required in single flux quantum (SFQ) logic families like RSFQ. The proposed FPL family can deliver up to two orders of magnitude improvement in integration density over RSFQ logic with a five-fold reduction in the bias current requirements. Circuit performance is enhanced with reduced latency and increased throughput. Furthermore, the FPL family provides a higher output voltage level and higher impedance, which better match those of CMOS circuits. The much smaller flux storage loops in FPL greatly reduce susceptibility to trapped flux and crosstalk. Advancements in fabrication processes that would further benefit FPL implementation include the use of NbTiN-based JJs with higher critical current density and fabrication temperature range up to 400~$^\\circ$C, or the use of stacked JJ structures. The resulting increased density makes very large-scale integration (VLSI) more practical. The FPL family has the potential to significantly advance SCE technology. Near-term applications are envisioned in accelerator cores for signal processing and artificial intelligence, with long-term potential in supercomputing applications. The advantages of FPL were demonstrated through an architectural study of a fast Fourier transform (FFT) circuit, comparing it with CMOS and SFQ technologies."}

The resolution achievable in pure metals, at one specific location within one reconstructed dataset, does not generally apply across materials or analysis conditions, or even throughout a single tomographic reconstruction. Here, we review various efforts at defining and measuring the spatial resolution in the study of single phase and single element materials - i.e. pure metals - in field-ion microscopy (FIM) and APT. We also report on the degradation of the resolution arising from ion optical devices used to improve the mass-resolution. We aim to offer some perspective as to how reported resolutions may be or may not be of any relevance to most of the materials characterisation efforts by APT, including cases of precipitates in a matrix that emphasise the need to consider an effective resolution. Finally, we discuss concepts to improve the spatial accuracy of the technique in a relatively distant future."}

Here, we report magnon transport and its emergent anisotropic nature in BiFeO$_3$ layers confined between ultrathin layers of the antiferromagnet LaFeO$_3$. Due to the confined state, BiFeO$_3$ serves as an efficient magnon transmission channel as well as a magnetoelectric knob by which to control the stack by means of an electric field. We discuss the mechanism of the anisotropic spin transport based on the interaction between the antiferromagnetic order and the electric field. This allows us to manipulate and amplify the spin transport in such a confined geometry. Furthermore, lower crystal symmetric and suppression of the spin cycloid in ultrathin BiFeO$_3$ stabilizes a non-trivial antiferromagnetic state exhibiting symmetry-protected spin-split bands that provide the non-trivial sign inversion of the spin current, which is a characteristic of an altermagnet. This work provides an understanding of the anisotropic spin transport in complex antiferromagnetic heterostructures where ferroelectricity and altermagnetism coexist, paving the way for a new route to realize electric-field control of a novel state of magnetism."}

Here we measure a high quality sample with residual resistivity ratio RRR = 605 under rotations in the $b-c$ plane up to 45 T. This extended field range helps to unambiguously demonstrate the spillover of SC3 outside the polarized paramagnetic state.

Within a minimal TI--SC model, we demonstrate that proximity-induced superconductivity at the buried interface generates a two-dimensional topological superconducting phase supporting Majorana edge modes. Using a Bogoliubov-de Gennes slab model and the Kubo formalism, we compute the optical conductance and introduce a thickness-extrapolation protocol that isolates the interface contribution only. The resulting interface conductance exhibits a robust, thickness-independent coherence peak at an energy set by the proximity-induced gap, distinguishable from both the parent superconductor's pair-breaking feature and the ungapped Dirac cone on the top surface. We further demonstrate that the low-frequency spectral weight of this interface resonance obeys a quantum-metric sum rule, quantitatively linking the optical response to the quantum geometry of the proximitized interfacial state.

The fundamental parameters of the superconducting (SC) state are the condensation energy per pair, $β_c$, and the antinodal energy gap, $Δ_p$, which are quantitatively extracted by fitting the cuprate quasiparticle spectrum from tunneling experiments.\n  An explicit formula for the critical temperature is also derived in the model. Valid for any doping, we find $T_c$ to be proportional to $β_c$, and not the gap $Δ_p$, in sharp contrast to conventional SC.

The obtained differential conductance curves show a common deviation from a single-gap superconducting behavior and can be better fitted by a two-gap Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk model, suggesting the larger gap $Δ_{L}$ with $2Δ_{L}$=3.7 $k_{B}T_{c}$ and the smaller gap $Δ_S$ yielding $2Δ_{S}$=1.1-2.2 $k_{B}T_{c}$ with a weak interband scattering.

Any comments or suggestions are greatly appreciated", "summary": "In gyrotropic crystals, an oscillating magnetic field induces a charge response known as the gyrotropic magnetic current. While its conventional origin is attributed to magnetic field modified band energy and shift in the Fermi-surface, a recent study identified an additional spin-driven magnetic displacement contribution. Here, we complete the picture by identifying the orbital counterpart of the magnetic displacement current. Using a density-matrix formulation that incorporates both minimal coupling and spin-Zeeman interactions, we derive the electronic equations of motion in the presence of an oscillating magnetic field and uncover a previously unexplored orbital contribution to the wavepacket velocity. Physically, this contribution arises from the time variation of the magnetic-field induced charge polarization. In the low frequency transport regime, this mechanism becomes purely intrinsic. We illustrate this intrinsic gyrotropic current of orbital origin in the ${\\cal P}{\\cal T}$-symmetric antiferromagnet CuMnAs. We show that the intrinsic gyrotropic magnetic current reverses sign upon Néel vector reversal, establishing it as a direct probe of antiferromagnetic order in CuMnAs and other $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric antiferromagnets."}

The goal of this work is to tailor the absorption and transmission spectrum of an non-magnetic epoxy resin containing sapphire spheres by simulating its dependence on the size distribution. Additionally, we fabricate several material compositions, characterize them, as well as other materials, at optical, infrared, and gigahertz frequencies. In the infrared region (stop band) the attenuation of the Mie-scattering optimized material is high and comparable to that of other commonly used filter materials.

Our aim is to understand and control photon-assisted quantum transport in this two-dimensional material under external driving. We use the Floquet approximation to describe the wave functions in the three regions of the system. By applying continuity conditions at the boundaries, we obtain a set of equations involving an infinite number of Floquet modes. We explicitly determine transmissions involving the central band $E$ and the first sidebands $E \\pm \\hbarω$. As for higher-order bands, we use the transfer matrix approach together with current density to compute the associated transmissions. Our results reveal that the transmission probability oscillates for both spin-up and spin-down electrons. The oscillations of spin-down electrons occur over nearly twice the period of spin-up electrons. Among all bands, the central one consistently shows the highest transmission. We also find that stronger laser fields and wider barriers both lead to reduced transmission. Moreover, laser irradiation enables controllable channeling and filtering of transmission bands by tuning the laser intensity and system parameters.

We show that even spin-singlet pairs and triplet pairs with $m=0$, both carrying no net spin, can transfer finite angular momentum through the quantum fluctuation term inherent to the $sd$ exchange interaction. The amount of transferred spin differs between the singlet and triplet $m=0$ states due to quantum interference. The difference is such that the independent-electron approximation remains valid for spin transfer when injected spin currents are completely incoherent. However, in partially coherent systems, like superconductor/ferromagnet junctions, coherent spin-singlet currents can directly convert into equal-spin triplet currents in generic ferromagnets, without requiring magnetic inhomogeniety or spin-orbit coupling."}

Existing machine learning approaches, such as equivariant graph neural networks, typically rely on specially-designed network architectures to enforce O(3) equivariance. However, to preserve equivariance, these specially-designed models restrict the update of equivariant features during message passing to linear transformations or gated equivariant nonlinearities. The inability to implicitly characterize more complex nonlinear structures may reduce the predictive accuracy of the model. In this study, we introduce a frame-averaging-based approach to achieve equivariant dielectric tensor prediction. We propose GoeCTP, an O(3)-equivariant framework that predicts dielectric tensors without imposing any structural restrictions on the backbone network. We benchmark its performance against several state-of-the-art models and further employ it for large-scale virtual screening of thermodynamically stable materials from the Materials Project database.

Recent break junction studies even question the spin-dependent electron flow across single chiral molecules. Here, we avoid ferromagnetic electrodes and magnetisation reversal to provide unambiguous experimental evidence for the chirality-induced spin selectivity effect of single enantiomers. Functionalising the superconducting tip of a scanning tunnelling microscope with a manganese atom cluster gives rise to Yu-Shiba-Rusinov resonances that serve as spin-sensitive probes of the tunnelling current in junctions of single heptahelicene molecules adsorbed on a crystalline lead surface. Our key finding is the dependence of the signal strength of these states in spectroscopy of the differential conductance on the handedness of the molecule.

Through exact analytical solutions, we show that this model contains not only hidden modes but multiple macroscopic hidden exceptional points that appear more generally in all systems with a non-trivial bulk winding.

Here, we combined density-functional theory and universal machine-learning interatomic potentials to study lateral interfaces between graphene and 45 metallenes with various profiles. We optimized the interfaces and analyzed their energies, electronic structures, and stabilities at room temperature, defect formations, and structural deformations. While broad trends were identified using machine-learning analysis of all interfaces, density-functional theory was the main tool for studying the microscopic properties of selected elements. We found that the interfaces are the most stable energetically and with respect to lattice mismatch, defect formation, and lateral strain when their profiles were geometrically smooth. The most stable interfaces are found for transition metals. In addition, we demonstrate how universal machine-learning interatomic potentials now offer the accuracy required for the modeling of graphene-metallene interfaces.

Here, using first-principles calculations, we reveal that monolayer CuVP$_2$Se$_6$ unites a tunable triple-well ferroelectric transition with a spin-polarized Chern flat band. The ferroelectric and paraelectric phases are close in energy and can be reversibly switched by moderate strain or an electric field. During the transition, a kagome-like flat band emerges near the Fermi level, which we describe via a minimal three-orbital tight-binding model on a triangular lattice. Furthermore, the system exhibits sizable magnetic anisotropy and a magnetization-dependent Chern insulating state: the Chern number is $C = \\pm 1$ for out-of-plane magnetization but becomes trivial when the moments rotate in-plane. These findings establish CuVP$_2$Se$_6$ as a promising candidate for exploring electrically tunable flat-band correlations and topological magnetism in a multiferroic monolayer."}

Known antiferroelectrics are relatively scarce and mainly based on a limited set of perovskite materials and their alloys (e.g., PbZrO$_3$, AgNbO$_3$, NaNbO$_3$). Here, a new family of lead-free, weberite-type antiferroelectrics, identified through a large-scale, first-principles computational search is introduced. The screening methodology, which connects lattice dynamics to antipolar distortions, predicted that La$_3$NbO$_7$ could exhibit antiferroelectricity. We confirm the prediction through the synthesis and characterization of epitaxial La$_3$NbO$_7$ thin films, which display the signature double hysteresis loops of an antiferroelectric material as well as clear evidence of an antipolar ground state structure from transmission electron microscopy. The antiferroelectricity in La$_3$NbO$_7$ is simpler than most known antiferroelectrics and can be explained by a Kittel-type mechanism involving the movement of niobium atoms in an oxygen octahedron through a single phonon mode which results in a smaller change in the volume during the field-induced phase transition. Additionally, it is found that La$_3$NbO$_7$ combines a high threshold field with a high breakdown field ($\\approx$ 6MV/cm) - which opens up opportunities for energy-storage applications. This new weberite-type family of materials offers many opportunities to tune electrical and temperature response especially through substitutions on the rare-earth site. Ultimately, this work demonstrates a successful data-driven theory-to-experiment discovery of an entirely new family of antiferroelectrics and provides a blueprint for the future design of ferroic materials."}

Therefore, density functional theory simulations were carried out to explore the adsorption energy and the distinct interaction regimes, where CO exhibits weak physisorption (-0.16 eV), while NO (-2.24 eV), NH3 (-1.47 eV), and SO2 (-1.51 eV) undergo strong chemisorption. Bader charge analysis reveals significant electron donation from 2D-B40 to NO and electron acceptance from SO2. These interactions cause measurable shifts in work function, with SO2 producing the most significant modulation (14.6%).

While atomistic simulations offer a route to computing liquid properties directly from atomic motion, the most accurate approach, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), is computationally costly and restricted to short time and length scales. Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLPs) offer AIMD accuracy at far lower cost, but their application to liquids is limited by training datasets that inadequately sample atomic configurations, leading to unphysical force predictions and unstable trajectories. Here we introduce a physically motivated dataset-engineering strategy that constructs liquidlike training data synthetically rather than relying on AIMD configurations. The method exploits the established icosahedral short-range order of metallic liquids, twelvefold, near-close-packed local coordination, and generates \"synthetic-liquid\" structures by systematic perturbation of crystalline references. MLPs trained on these datasets close the sampling gaps that lead to unphysical predictions, remain numerically stable across temperatures, and reproduce experimental liquid densities, diffusivities, and melting temperatures for multiple elemental metals. The framework links atomic-scale sampling to long-term MD stability and provides a practical route to predictive modeling of liquid-phase thermophysical behavior beyond the limits of direct AIMD."}

Using this technique, we directly probe a laser-excited phase transition in the prototypical material vanadium dioxide (VO2), recording its spatiotemporal propagation. This direct imaging capability reveals the dynamics of the structural phase transition and connects it to the resulting strain formation on picosecond timescales. This correlation reveals how atomic-scale symmetry breaking inherently generates lattice distortions, which then propagate to govern macroscopic property changes.

In the paper, we present a synchrotron radiation study of the electronic band structure of Sn(0.9)Mn(0.1)Te by resonant photoemission. The contribution of the Mn3d electrons to the valence band (VB), calculated as the difference between the Energy Distribution Curves (EDCs) taken at the maximum and minimum of the Fano resonance for the Mn3p - Mn3d absorption threshold, shows a contribution at the VB edge, a dominant maximum at 4 eV, as well as a wide structure between 7 and 11 eV.

To be presented at APS", "summary": "Flat bands are associated with a range of desirable physical phenomena and potential applications, including enhanced superconducting tendencies due to the high density of states, strongly correlated phases such as quantum Hall states. Systems in which flat bands can be switched or tuned are therefore of particular interest. In this study, we analyze the electronic structure of two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) subjected to a linearly increasing magnetic-field dipole together with a transverse electric field, using the operator formalism of the quantum harmonic oscillator. When the electric field magnitude is tuned to a sequence of discrete values, different levels of energy bands are flattened. Moreover, at a specific electric field strength, the ground-state wave function admits an exact closed-form solution that can be understood through the magnetic drifts cancellation in the classical electrodynamics. We also demonstrate two distinct transmission properties, the quantized Hall conductance and the enhanced density of states, of the electrically switchable flat band. These findings establish a new route toward magnetoelectric band engineering and electrically guided transport in low-dimensional systems."}

The Fermi arcs on the two different (0001) surface terminations have been associated with the set of Weyl points just above the Fermi energy (E$_F$). Here using first-principles calculations to explore the band crossings over the full Brillouin zone between the nominally highest valence and lowest conduction bands in $γ$-PtBi$_2$, we find a Weyl nodal loop (WNL) and multiple sets of Weyl points (WPs). The main difference between the two reported experimental structural parameters is the magnitude of Bi-layer buckling. While the WNL, bulk gap region and the set of Weyl points just above the E$_F$ are robust, the number and location of the other sets of WPs depend sensitively on the structural parameters with different magnitude of Bi-layer buckling.

This new scheme exploits a symmetry-hierarchy due to SOC induced symmetry-breaking, so that nontrivial band topology can be revealed by SSG, that is yet invisible by the conventional MSG-based method, as exemplified by real triple points in ferromagnetic CaCu$_3$Fe$_2$Sb$_2$O$_{12}$, Dirac nodal lines at generic $k$-points in antiferromagnetic FePSe$_3$ and Weyl nodal lines in altermagnetic Sr$_4$Fe$_4$O$_{11}$. Notably, FePSe$_3$ is topologically trivial under MSG but hosts Dirac nodal lines within the SSG framework. Upon including SOC, these nodal lines are gapped and generate a sizable anomalous Hall conductivity. Despite a vanishing bulk net magnetism, FePSe$_3$ can host topologically protected surface states with large non-relativistic band spin-splitting. Moreover, topology in MTMs is tunable by rotating the magnetic moment direction once SOC is included, as exemplified in Sr$_4$Fe$_4$O$_{11}$.The interplay of topology with non-relativistic and SOC-induced control of properties via magnetic moment reorientation in the predicted MTMs is worthy of further studies in future."}

These materials underpin organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), which translate such interactions into low-voltage signal amplification and sensing for applications in bioelectronics, neuromorphic computing, and memory. Despite their central role, OECT current-voltage transfer characteristics are often treated phenomenologically, as both the local multimodal dynamics and their connection to global device response remain unresolved. Here, we reveal that the transfer curve encodes a cascade of spatially localized electrochemical transitions, each associated with distinct changes in conductivity, stiffness, and morphology, fundamentally redefining it as a spatially resolved fingerprint of device's internal state. Using automated operando multimodal in-liquid scanning dielectric microscopy, we directly map these dynamics and identify region-specific electrochemical thresholds governing the interplay between source, channel, and drain. We found that the local tip-sample electrostatic force serves as a remarkable mechanistic observable of coupled multimodal dynamics in mixed conductors. A physically grounded model links it to general material, interfacial, and geometric parameters, enabling mechanistic interpretation and predictive insights.

The fundamental parameters of the superconducting (SC) state are the condensation energy per pair, $β_c$, and the antinodal energy gap, $Δ_p$, which are quantitatively extracted by fitting the cuprate quasiparticle spectrum from tunneling experiments.\n  An explicit formula for the critical temperature is also derived in the model. Valid for any doping, we find $T_c$ to be proportional to $β_c$, and not the gap $Δ_p$, in sharp contrast to conventional SC.

The amount of transferred spin differs between the singlet and triplet $m=0$ states due to quantum interference. The difference is such that the independent-electron approximation remains valid for spin transfer when injected spin currents are completely incoherent.
