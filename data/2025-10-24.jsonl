For instance, for the superfluid stiffness or the\npairing mechanism, these geometric aspects can play an important role.

We analyze how the\nformer effects lead to \"quantum geometric pair breaking\", where any\nsuperconductor becomes susceptible to microscopically non-magnetic impurities,\nand formally relate it to the maximum possible localization of two-particle\nWannier states. Further, in the presence of kinetic pair breaking, impurities\ncan also enhance pairing, leading to an overall more complex, non-monotonic\nbehavior of $T_c$ with impurity concentration.

We measure electron dephasing rates via\nmagnetoresistance from $T_\\mathrm{c}$ to $\\sim 4T_\\mathrm{c}$ in\nvarious-thickness TiN films. Electron dephasing occurs on the picosecond\ntimescale and is nearly independent of temperature, differing from the expected\ninelastic scattering due to the electron-phonon and electron-electron\ninteractions near $T_\\mathrm{c}$, which occur over a nanosecond timescale. We\npropose spin-flip scattering as a possible additional phase-breaking mechanism.\nThe significant increase in the dephasing rate for the thinnest film indicates\nthat magnetic disorder resides near the surface of naturally oxidized films.\nOur research suggests that magnetic disorder may be a significant contributor\nto RF dissipation in superconducting devices based on TiN."}
