Here, we identify an alternative EO mechanism in bulk metallic\nsystems that arises from the interplay between Berry curvature and the orbital\nmagnetic moment of Bloch electrons. Focusing on twisted double-bilayer graphene\n(TDBG), we show that the enhanced intrinsic properties of moir\\'e Bloch bands\ngive rise to a sizable linear magnetoelectric EO response, a first-order,\nelectric-field-induced non-Hermitian correction to the gyrotropic magnetic\nsusceptibility. This mechanism dominates in $C_{3z}$-symmetric TDBG, where EO\ncontributions originating from the Berry curvature dipole (BCD) are\nsymmetry-forbidden. Our calculations reveal giant, gate-tunable linear and\ncircular dichroism in the terahertz regime, establishing a robust and tunable\nplatform for ultrafast EO modulation in two-dimensional materials beyond the\nBCD paradigm."}

In particular, the disorder\nmust be smaller than the superconducting gap for the appearance of Majorana\nmodes, but the disorder-induced appearance of subgap Andreev-bound states\nsuppresses the Majorana modes. We theoretically investigate, as a function of\ndisorder, the normal state ballistic transport properties of nanowires with and\nwithout superconductors in order to provide guidance on how to experimentally\nestimate the level of disorder. Experimentally, the superconductivity is\nsuppressed simply by rotating the magnetic field appropriately, so both physics\ncan be studied in the same set-up. In particular, the presence of spin-orbit\ncoupling and Zeeman splitting produces a helical gap in the 1D electronic band\nstructure, which should have clear signatures in ballistic transport unless\nthese signatures are suppressed by disorder and/or Fabry-P\\'erot resonances\nassociated with the finite wire sizes.

A robust and uniform valley splitting across the entire chip is\ncrucial for achieving scalability in the architecture and reliability in\noperation. Imperfections such as broadened interfaces, alloy disorders and\natomic steps significantly compromise the valley splitting. The associated\nscattering mechanisms play detrimental roles in the performance of the qubits.\nIn this manuscript, exploiting low-temperature magnetotransport measurements,\nwe investigate the scattering mechanisms and valley splitting in a\nhigh-mobility undoped Si-SiGe 2DEG. At lower carrier densities, transport is\nlimited by remote impurity scattering, whereas at higher densities, background\nimpurity scattering near the quantum well dominates. Both the transport and\nquantum lifetimes of the charge carriers increase with carrier concentration,\ndue to the enhancement in the impurity screening. Magnetic-field-induced\nconfinement effect also is found to improve the valley splitting.\nCurrent-biasing measurements reveals the role of carrier heating in the\nvisibility of valley splitting and reveal a temperature limited valley\nsplitting of approximately 100 micro-eV.

The diversity\nof these defects, characterized morphologically and statistically, defines what\nis called the \"primary damage\". In this work, we present a fully unsupervised\nmachine learning (ML) workflow that detects and classifies these defects\ndirectly from molecular dynamics data. Local environments are encoded by the\nSmooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP) vector, anomalous atoms are isolated\nwith autoencoder neural networks (AE), embedded with Uniform Man- ifold\nApproximation and Projection (UMAP) and clustered using Hierarchical\nDensity-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN). Applied\nto 80 keV displacement cascades in Ni, Fe70Ni10Cr20, and Zr, the AE\nsuccessfully identify the small fraction of outlier atoms that participate in\ndefect formation. HDBSCAN then partitions the UMAP latent space of AE-flagged\nSOAP de- scriptors into well defined groups representing vacancy- and\ninterstitial-dominated regions and, within each, separates small from large\naggregates, assigning 99.7 % of outliers to compact physical motifs. A signed\ncluster-identification score confirms this separation, and cluster size scales\nwith net defect counts (R2 > 0.89). Statistical cross analyses between the ML\noutlier map and several conventional detectors (centrosymmetry, dislocation\nextraction, etc.) reveal strong overlap and complementary coverage, all\nachieved without template or threshold tuning. This ML workflow thus provides\nan efficient tool for the quantitative mapping of structural anomalies in\nmaterials, particularly those arising from irradiation damage in displacement\ncascades."}

To fully harness\nthese electronic features, the ability to tune the Fermi level relative to the\nband positions is needed. Here we explore the structural, electronic and\nmagnetic impacts of substitutional alloying within ferromagnetic kagome metal\nFe3Sn2 in thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. Transition metals Mn and\nCo are chosen as substitutes for Fe to reduce or increase the d-band electron\ncount, thereby moving the Fermi level accordingly. We find that Co is not\nincorporated into the Fe3Sn2 structure but instead results in a two-phase Fe-Co\nand (Fe,Co)Sn composite. In contrast, Fe3-xMnxSn2 films are realized with x up\nto 1.0, retaining crystalline quality comparable to the parent phase. The\nincorporation of Mn repositions the flat bands relative to the Fermi level in a\nmanner consistent with hole-doping, as revealed by hard x-ray photoemission and\ndensity functional theory. The Fe3-xMnxSn2 films retain room temperature\nferromagnetism, with x-ray magnetic circular dichroism measurements confirming\nthat the Fe and Mn moments are ferromagnetically aligned.

The layered antiferromagnet MnPS3 offers a unique\nopportunity to explore defect-related magnetism, as Mn2+ vacancies can be\ngenerated by the intercalation of specific guest molecules. However, the\neffectiveness of this process in atomically thin flakes and the extent of the\nmagnetic tunability remain unclear. Here, we show that the magnetic properties\nof MnPS3 can be tailored through the intercalation of different guest\nmolecules. Notably, the insertion of four alkylammonium ions introduces\ndifferent populations of Mn2+ vacancies, leading to a transition from the\npristine antiferromagnetic state to more complex magnetic textures, including a\nferrimagnetic state displaying a magnetic saturation of 1 uB/atom. Moreover, we\nshow that the intercalation of few-nm-thick flakes also leads to the emergence\nof a ferrimagnetic response. This in-flake intercalation, which can be\nmonitored in real time using optical microscopy, can be interrupted before\ncompletion, generating lateral heterostructures between pristine and\nintercalated areas. This approach opens the way to the use of partial\nintercalation to define regions with distinct magnetic properties within a\nsingle flake."}

Under boundary\nlubrication, Si-doped DLC (Si-DLC) exhibited the lowest coefficient of friction\n($\\approx$0.045) and nearly 45% lower wear than undoped DLC. Co-DLC showed\nmoderate improvement, while Ag-DLC provided no significant benefit.\nCross-sectional FIB-TEM revealed thin tribofilms, 12-17 nm in thickness, on Si-\nand Co-doped surfaces. As reported for Si-DLC, these films incorporate\ncopolymer-derived fragments, suggesting a similar composition for Co-DLC. These\nresults indicate that dopant-polymer interactions are key to the development of\nself-organized boundary layers. To gain atomic-level insight, first-principles\ncalculations were carried out on the adsorption of the dimethylaminoethyl\nmethacrylate (DMAEMA) unit, the copolymer's functional group. The calculated\nadsorption energies were $-$2.27 to $-$0.57 eV for Si-DLC, $-$1.73 to $-$1.49\neV for Co(0001), and $-$1.21 to $-$1.08 eV for Ag(111). The order of stability\n(Si $>$ Co $>$ Ag) was consistent with the experimental tribological ranking.\nChemical bonding dominated for Si-DLC, while Ag showed mainly weak\nphysisorption. Simulated pull-off forces further reflected this hierarchy, with\nN-Si bonds requiring about twice the force of N-Co and nearly five times that\nof N-Ag. The correspondence between adsorption strength and tribological\nresponse highlights the decisive role of dopant species in tribofilm formation.\nThese findings provide guidance for designing durable low-friction surfaces in\napplications such as electric drivetrains and precision mechanical systems."}

We\napply this theory to identify the geometric mechanisms of third-order nonlinear\ntransport in materials both with and without time-reversal symmetry, such as 2D\nmaterials, topological materials, and altermagnets.
