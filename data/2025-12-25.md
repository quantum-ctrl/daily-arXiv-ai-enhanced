Abstract: Electronic scattering is a powerful tool to identify underlying changes in electronic behavior and incipient electronic and magnetic orders. The nematic and magnetic phases are strongly intertwined under applied pressure in FeSe, however, the additional isoelectronic substitution of sulphur offers an elegant way to separate them. Here we report the detailed evolution of the electronic and superconducting behaviour of FeSe$_{0.96}$S$_{0.04}$ under applied pressure via longitudinal magnetoresistance studies up to 15T. At intermediate pressures, inside the nematic phase, the resistivity displays an upturn in zero magnetic field, which is significantly enhanced in the magnetic field, suggesting the stabilization of a spin-density wave phase, which competes with superconductivity. At higher pressures, beyond the nematic phase boundaries, the resistivity no longer displays any clear anomalies in the zero magnetic field, but an external magnetic field induces significant upturns in resistivity reflecting a field-induced order, where superconductivity and magnetic anomalies are enhanced in tandem. This study highlights the essential role of high magnetic fields in stabilizing different electronic phases and revealing a complex interplay between magnetism and superconductivity tuned by applied pressure in FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_{x}$.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The discovery of superconducting nickelates provides a unique opportunity to explore the pairing mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity. Here, we use ultrafast terahertz spectroscopy to probe the temperature-dependent superfluid density in an infinite-layer samarium nickelate film with a Tc of 20 K. The superfluid density decreases linearly with rising temperature, consistent with clean limit d-wave pairing. From this linear relation, we extract a superconducting gap of 2.5 meV and a gap-to-Tc ratio of 3, suggesting that this sample lies in the weak-coupling limit. Furthermore, the ratio of the mean free path to the coherence length, is determined to be 1.5, confirming the clean-limit behavior. These findings establish strong parallels between the pairing mechanisms in nickelate and cuprate superconductors.

Abstract: Atomic cells made by anodically bonding silicon and borosilicate glasses are widely used in atomic devices.
  One inherent problem in these cells is that the silicon material blocks beams with wavelengths shorter than
  1000 nm, which limits available optical accesses when alkali metal atoms are involved. In this work, we
  investigate the possibility of the silicon carbide material as an alternative of silicon materials in fabricating
  anodically bonded cells. We demonstrate that the optical, thermal and mechanical properties of silicon carbide
  help to improve the performance of atomic devices in certain applications.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The effects of inter-defect interaction on the defect thermodynamics, local structure, and oxidation of acceptor-doped wide-gap ABO3 perovskites are explored using the developed statistical theory and Monte Carlo simulations. The results demonstrate that under realistic energy parameters the interaction between oxygen vacancies and impurities generally has a greater impact on the studied properties than inter-vacancy correlations. The influence of inter-vacancy interaction significantly depends on dopant content x: inter-site vacancy repulsion becomes noticeable at sufficiently high x, whereas on-site Fermi-type correlations can be pronounced within a narrow doping range at moderate x values. It is found that a non-uniform impurity allocation, which can result from a sample preparation procedure, considerably affects oxygen-vacancy distribution, and has a weaker effect on short-range order and oxidation. It is also shown that inter-defect interaction reduces the hole concentration, increases the oxidation enthalpy, and can result in their non-trivial dependence on x. The findings of this study contribute to understanding the fundamental properties of acceptor-doped oxides, facilitating the development of new materials for clean energy applications.

Abstract: Since the first evidence of luminescence of organic polymers in STM junctions, efforts have been invested in elucidating how to leverage the voltage, anchoring chemistry, and molecular structure to optimize emission power and efficiency. Understanding the fundamentals underlying current-driven molecular emission is important not only for OLED engineering, but also to control luminescence at the atomic scale toward the mastering of single or localized photon sources. However, the difficulty in isolating the separate roles of the variables at play in molecular junction experiments, has precluded a general comprehension of their distinctive effects on the emitted power and the quantum yield. In the present report, we use time-dependent electronic structure simulations based on quantum electrodynamics to disentangle the incidence of bias, electronic coupling and molecular length on device performance, with polyphenylene-vinylene as a case study. A careful validation demonstrates that our approach can achieve quantitative agreement with available experimental data. Through its application we identify the applied bias as the main factor determining emission power. The quantum efficiency, however, is influenced only minimally by bias and electronic coupling, and is instead dominated by polymer length, on which it depends exponentially. Thus, using longer polymer chains emerges as the primary strategy for achieving higher efficiencies. Our results thereby provide key prescriptions for designing single-molecule electroluminescent platforms.

Abstract: Simulations of SiC crystal growth using molecular dynamics (MD) have become popular in recent years. They, however, simulate very fast deposition rates, to reduce computational costs. Therefore, they are more akin to surface sputtering, leading to abnormal growth effects, including thick amorphous layers and large defect densities. A recently developed method, called the minimum energy atomic deposition (MEAD), tries to overcome this problem by depositing the atoms directly at the minimum energy positions, increasing the time scale.
  We apply the MEAD method to simulate SiC crystal growth on stepped C-terminated 4H substrates with 4° and 8° off-cut angle. We explore relevant calculations settings, such as amount of equilibration steps between depositions and influence of simulation cell sizes and bench mark different interatomic potentials. The carefully calibrated methodology is able to replicate the stable step-flow growth, which was so far not possible using conventional MD simulations. Furthermore, the simulated crystals are evaluated in terms of their dislocations, surface roughness and atom mobility. Our methodology paves the way for future high fidelity investigations of surface phenomena in crystal growth.

Abstract: Unintentionally formed interfacial layers are ubiquitous in semiconductor devices that operate at extreme conditions. However, these layers' structure and properties often remain unknown due to the thinness of these naturally formed interphases. Here, we report on the intentional epitaxial growth and semiconductor properties of NiGa2O4 spinel layers that form at Ga2O3/NiO interfaces used in high-power and high-temperature electronic devices. Cubic spinel NiGa2O4 films of 10-50 nm thicknesses and low surface roughness (~ 2 nm) were grown using pulsed laser deposition at a substrate temperatures in the 300-900 °C range on α-Al2O3 and β-Ga2O3 substrates of different orientation. The optical absorption onset (3.6-3.9 eV) and thermal conductivity (4-9 W m-1 K-1) vary systematically with substrate temperature, consistent with theoretical predictions of varying Ni and Ga cation ordering on the spinel lattice. The valence band offset between NiGa2O4 and β-Ga2O3 is determined to be 1.8 eV. The NiGa2O4-based p-n heterojunction devices on Ga2O3 (001) substrates exhibit a rectification ratio of 10^8 (for +/-2V) and a turn-on voltage of 1.4 V, maintaining diode behavior up to 600 °C. These results highlight the potential of NiGa2O4 as a p-type interlayer in Ga2O3-based devices and shows a new approach to investigate such interfacial layers.

Abstract: Ultrathin polymer-graphene heterostructures are promising materials for next generation optoelectronic and photovoltaic technologies, while the influence of the polymer's structural variation on interfacial charge transfer remains unclear. Here, using ab initio quantum mechanical calculations we show how different forms of Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), a widely used organic semiconductor, interact with graphene. We analyze the effects of molecular chain length, end-group termination, periodicity, and the distinction between ordered and random P3HT arrangements. For isolated P3HT, the band gap decreases with increasing chain length and layer thickness, while structural disorder leads to slightly larger gaps due to reduced electronic coupling. When P3HT is deposited on graphene, all configurations exhibit spontaneous charge transfer, with electrons accumulating on graphene and holes remaining in the polymer. This effect is significantly enhanced in ordered and fully periodic structures and is noticeably weaker in disordered ones. Charge density analyses further show that thicker and more ordered P3HT layers improve electron hole separation across the interface. Our results reveal how molecular structure governs charge transfer in P3HT-graphene heterojunctions and provide practical guidelines for designing high efficiency polymer-graphene photovoltaic devices.

Abstract: Emergent behavior,which arises from local interactions between simple elements,is pervasive in nature. It underlies the exceptional energy-efficient computing in our brains. However,realizing such dynamics in artificial materials, particularly under low-energy stimuli, remains a fundamental challenge.Here we harness and amplify them to construct a strongly dipolar-coupled network of SmCo5 macrospins at wafer scale, which can exhibit intrinsic interaction-driven collective dynamics in response to voltage pulses. The network combines three essential ingredients,i.e.strong dipolar coupling enabled by large single-domain macrospin, giant voltage control of coercivity over nearly 1000-fold, the largest reported to date, and a disordered network topology with frustrated Ising-like energy landscape. When stimulated by 1 V pulses, the network enters a regime where interaction-driven magnetic behaviors emerge, including spontaneous demagnetization, greatly enhanced magnetization modulation, reversible freeze and resume evolution and stochastic convergence toward low-energy magnetic configurations. All these behaviors are completely absent at the single-nanomagnet level. Furthermore, by constructing micromagnetic models of the strongly dipolar-coupled macrospin networks calibrated to experiments, we show that the resulting nonlinear, high-dimensional collective dynamics, which are characteristic of strongly-interacting systems, can enable accurate chaotic Mackey-Glass prediction and multiclass drone-signal classification. Our work establishes the voltage-responsive strongly-coupled SmCo5 network as a mesoscopic platform for probing emergent magnetic dynamics previously inaccessible under ambient conditions.It also suggests a fundamental distinct route towards scalable,low-voltage computing, one rooted in native physical interaction-driven collective dynamics at the network level.

Abstract: The layered van der Waals (vdW) ferroelectric CuInP2S6 (CIPS) exhibits unique cation hopping-driven phenomena that bring about unconventional properties with intriguing mechanisms and hold promises for advanced applications in nanoelectronics. However, an explicit analysis of its lattice dynamics and vibrational symmetries, pivotal for understanding the material's peculiar ferroelectric and ferroionic behaviors, remains incomplete. Here, we employ angle-resolved polarized Raman spectroscopy in concert with first-principles calculations to systematically unravel the anisotropic lattice vibrations of CIPS single crystals. By analyzing the polarization-dependent Raman intensities, we determine the symmetry assignments and Raman tensors of all major vibrational modes, revealing good agreement with theoretical predictions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of Raman spectroscopy as a sensitive and non-invasive probe for structural and ferroelectric order evolution, by examining temperature-driven phase transitions and thickness-dependent polarization suppression in CIPS. Our findings establish a foundational framework for correlating lattice dynamics with functional properties in CIPS and provide a methodological blueprint for studying other vdW ferroelectrics.

Abstract: An ab initio approach is presented for studying the collective excitations in excitonic insulators, charge/spin density waves and superconductors. We derive the Bethe-Salpeter-Equation for the particle-hole excitations in the quasiparticle representation, from which the collective excited states are solved and the corresponding order parameter fluctuations are computed. This method is demonstrated numerically for the excitonic insulating phases of the biased WSe2-MoSe2 bilayer. It reveals the gapless phase-mode, the subgap Bardasis-Schrieffer modes and the above-gap scattering states. Our work paves the way for quantitative predictions of excited state phenomena from first-principles calculations in electronic systems with spontaneous symmetry breaking.

Abstract: We present MOCVD-grown, nitrogen-doped \b{eta}-Ga2O3 films as an insulating buffer layer on Fe-doped (010) \b{eta}-Ga2O3 substrates in lieu of 49% HF treatment to remove unintentional silicon at the substrate-epitaxial layer growth interface. N-doped layer thickness and NH3 flow were systematically varied to experimentally determine the lowest nitrogen concentration and thickness of the buffer layer needed to fully compensate the interfacial silicon peak. The NH3 molar flow rate was varied from 200 sccm to 1800 sccm. Results showed fully insulating N-doped layers for samples with NH3 flow rates greater than or equal to 1200 sccm and a thickness of 50 nm. This study demonstrates the efficacy of in-situ, controllably doped nitrogen buffer layers as a mitigation method for unintentional interfacial silicon at the substrate-epitaxial layer growth interface.

Abstract: The evolution of cluster structure with size and the critical size for the transition from cluster to nanocrystal have long been fundamental problems in nanoscience. Due to limitations of experimental technology and computational methods, the exploration of the continuous evolution of clusters towards nanocrystal is still a big challenge. Here, we proposed a machine learning force field (MLFF) that can generalize well to various copper systems ranging from small clusters to large clusters and bulk. The continuous evolution of copper clusters CuN towards nanocrystal was revealed by investigating clusters in a wide size range (7 <= N <= 17885) based on MLFF simulated annealing. For small CuN (N < 40), electron counting rule plays a major role in stability. For large CuN (N > 80), geometric magic number rule plays a dominant role and the evolution of clusters is based on the formation of more and more icosahedral shells. For medium size CuN (40 <= N <= 80), both rules contribute. The critical size from cluster to nanocrystal was calculated to be around 8000 atoms (about 6 nm in diameter). Our work terminates the long-term challenge in nanoscience, and lay the methodological foundation for subsequent research on other cluster systems.

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials are promising candidates for next-generation spintronic devices due to their tunable properties and potential for efficient spin-charge interconversion. However, discovering materials with intrinsically high spin Hall conductivity (SHC) is hindered by the vast chemical space and expensive nature of conventional experimental and first-principles methods. In this work, we employ an active learning framework to accelerate the discovery of high-SHC 2D materials. Machine learning (ML) models were trained on SHC values computed from density functional theory calculations, incorporating the Kubo formalism via tight-binding Hamiltonians constructed from maximally localized Wannier functions, with explicit treatment of spin-orbit coupling. Starting from random but chemically diverse 24 2D systems, the dataset was expanded to 41 cases (from an overall pool of around 2000 materials) over three active learning loops using an expected improvement acquisition strategy. The ML technique successfully identified several high SHC candidates with the best candidate exhibiting a SHC of 271.52 (hbar/e) Ohm^-1, nearly 23 times higher than the top performer in the initial round. Beyond candidate discovery, several features such as orbital symmetry near the Fermi energy, types of atomic species, material composition, covalent radii, and electronegativity of constituent atoms were found to play critical role in shaping the spin Hall response in 2D systems. The data generated is made publicly available to facilitate further advances in 2D spintronics.

Abstract: Spin-orbit torque efficiency is conventionally fixed by bulk materials. $D$-wave altermagnets introduce an additional nonrelativistic spin-charge conversion channel beyond inverse spin-Hall effect. Using prototypical candidate RuO$_2$ as an example, we show that the adjacent ferromagnet alone can dictate both the magnitude and sign of spin-charge conversion. Spin-pumping measurements on RuO$_2$/Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$ (YIG) and RuO$_2$/Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$ (Py) bilayers yield opposite effective spin-Hall angles that persist across crystalline and polycrystalline RuO$_2$. Inserting an ultrathin Au spacer at the RuO$_2$/YIG interface reverses the signal, envidencing a dominant interfacial inverse Rashba-Edelstein effect, whereas RuO$_2$/Py is governed by bulk inverse spin-Hall effect. First-principles calculations trace this dichotomy to interface-selective band hybridization: Rashba surface states survive at the insulating YIG contact yet are quenched by metallic Py. Our findings establish ferromagnetic interfacing as a deterministic knob for tailoring spin-charge conversion in altermagnetic oxides, paving the way to field-free, low-dissipation spintronic memory devices.

Abstract: Single-layer transition metal dihalides grown on conducting substrates were shown to host stable polarons. Here, we investigate polarons in insulating single-layer MnBr$_2$ grown by molecular beam epitaxy on three different substrates, namely graphene on Ir(110), graphene on Ir(111), and Au(111). The number densities and species of polarons observed vary strongly as a function of the substrate. For MnBr$_2$ grown on Ir(110) the largest number of polaron species is observed, namely four, of which three show clear similarities with the species observed for CoCl$_2$ on graphite. Polarons in single-layer MnBr$_2$ are observed up to 300K. They can be created, converted, and moved by the STM tip when a tunneling current flows at a proper bias voltage. For graphene on Ir(110) as a substrate, mobile polarons in MnBr$_2$ are guided through the periodic potential imposed from the super-moiré resulting from the interaction of MnBr$_2$ with graphene and Ir(110). Our findings indicate that modeling of polarons in such single-layer insulators in contact with a conducting substrate requires to take the substrate explicitly into account.

Abstract: The review treats Heusler alloys that display distinctive functional properties, including shape-memory behavior and magnetocaloric effects. Particular emphasis is placed on Heusler systems in which half-metallic ferromagnetism and spin-gapless semiconductor state are realized. Although these compounds are crystallographically rather "ordinary", peculiarities of their electronic structure and magnetic state lead to unconventional kinetic and magnetic properties. Their magnetic and transport characteristics are highly sensitive to external stimuli, and changes in alloy composition or external parameters can induce transitions between the states considered. This tunability provides further opportunities for controlling the electronic and magnetic properties of Heusler alloys and for exploiting them in applications such as spintronics and micro- and nanoelectronics.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce PhononBench, the first large-scale benchmark for dynamical stability in AI-generated crystals. Leveraging the recently developed MatterSim interatomic potential, which achieves DFT-level accuracy in phonon predictions across more than 10,000 materials, PhononBench enables efficient large-scale phonon calculations and dynamical-stability analysis for 108,843 crystal structures generated by six leading crystal generation models. PhononBench reveals a widespread limitation of current generative models in ensuring dynamical stability: the average dynamical-stability rate across all generated structures is only 25.83%, with the top-performing model, MatterGen, reaching just 41.0%. Further case studies show that in property-targeted generation-illustrated here by band-gap conditioning with MatterGen--the dynamical-stability rate remains as low as 23.5% even at the optimal band-gap condition of 0.5 eV. In space-group-controlled generation, higher-symmetry crystals exhibit better stability (e.g., cubic systems achieve rates up to 49.2%), yet the average stability across all controlled generations is still only 34.4%. An important additional outcome of this study is the identification of 28,119 crystal structures that are phonon-stable across the entire Brillouin zone, providing a substantial pool of reliable candidates for future materials exploration. By establishing the first large-scale dynamical-stability benchmark, this work systematically highlights the current limitations of crystal generation models and offers essential evaluation criteria and guidance for their future development toward the design and discovery of physically viable materials. All model-generated crystal structures, phonon calculation results, and the high-throughput evaluation workflows developed in PhononBench will be openly released at https://github.com/xqh19970407/PhononBench

Abstract: Black phosphorus and its single-layer constituent, phosphorene, have emerged as promising two-dimensional materials with remarkable tribological properties. However, recent experimental investigations reveal complex substrate-dependent behavior that affects their lubricating capabilities. This computational study employs density functional theory calculations to quantify the adhesion energy of both pristine and oxidized phosphorene monolayers on various metallic substrates (aluminum, copper, iron, and chromium) and their corresponding oxides ($\mathrm{Al_2O_3}$, $\mathrm{Cu_2O}$, $\mathrm{Fe_2O_3}$, and $\mathrm{Cr_2O_3}$), correlating these fundamental interactions with experimentally observed tribological performance. Results demonstrate that oxidized phosphorene exhibits greater stability than its pristine counterpart and shows higher adhesion to all substrates, attributed to favorable interactions between oxygen non-bonding states and substrate empty states. Adhesion is systematically more favorable on pristine metals than on their corresponding oxides, with chromium and iron showing particularly strong interactions due to partially filled 3d orbitals. This result is consistent with the coefficient of friction decrease observed in tribological experiments after scratching the substrate, thus removing the outermost oxide layer. Charge redistribution and electronic structure analyses reveal system-dependent interfacial bonding characteristics, with some configurations inducing metallic character in phosphorene. These findings provide fundamental insights into substrate-dependent black phosphorus lubricating properties, highlighting the key role of layer-substrate adhesion.

Abstract: As we move beyond the era of transistor miniaturization, back-end-of-line-compatible transistors that can be stacked monolithically in the third dimension promise improved performance for low-power electronics. In advanced transistor architectures, such as gate-all-around nanosheets, the conventional channel-first process involves depositing dielectrics directly onto the channel. Atomic layer deposition of gate dielectrics on back-end-of-line compatible channel materials, such as amorphous oxide semiconductors, can induce defects or cause structural modifications that degrade electrical performance. While post-deposition annealing can partially repair this damage, it often degrades other device metrics. We report a novel channel-last concept that prevents such damage. Channel-last gate-all-around self-aligned transistors with amorphous oxide-semiconductor channels exhibit high on-state current ($>$ 1 mA/$μ$m) and low subthreshold swing (minimum of 63 mV/dec) without the need for post-deposition processing. This approach offers a general, scalable pathway for transistors with atomic layer deposited channel materials, enabling the future of low-power three-dimensional electronics.

Abstract: Silicon spin qubits offer long coherence times, a compact footprint and compatibility with industrial CMOS manufacturing. Here, we investigate spin qubits hosted in quantum dots fabricated in a state-of-the-art 300 mm nanoelectronics foundry and demonstrate substantially enhanced coherence, achieving a Hahn-echo time of $T_2^{\text{Hahn}} = 4\,\mathrm{ms}$ for singlet--triplet oscillations. Employing noise spectroscopy and noise correlation measurements, we identify detuning noise with an amplitude of $δ\varepsilon_{\mathrm{rms}} = 2.2\,μ\mathrm{eV}$ (integrated over 90 s) and observe strong zero-phase correlations between two spatially separated spin qubits. The singlet--triplet basis intrinsically rejects these common-mode fluctuations, yielding a pronounced suppression of dephasing. Our results suggest that exploiting the versatility of silicon quantum dots to adapt the qubit encoding to the microscopic noise landscape represents a promising strategy for advancing scalable quantum information processing.

Abstract: Quantized charge pumping in one-dimensional chiral wires has been widely studied in the context of topological physics in a (1+1)-dimensional synthetic space, yet the role of orbital and spin degrees of freedom in such topological pumps remains largely unexplored. Here, we examine how the topologically quantized charge pump in insulators generates spin polarizations, and assess whether this mechanism may offer distinct insight into the widely known spin-selective transport in chiral wires-commonly referred to as chirality-induced spin selectivity. We performed time-dependent Schrodinger equations of multi-orbital tight-binding Hamiltonians driven by a circularly polarized electric field. Our main findings are twofold. First, the intrinsic screw-like geometry of the system generates a distinctive winding structure governed by a single control parameter, in contrast to conventional adiabatic pumping mechanisms that require at least two independently modulated parameters, thereby providing a clear interpretation of one-dimensional pumping in terms of the topological structure in a (1+1)-dimensional Brillouin zone. Second, while the energy gap remains open throughout the pumping cycle, the Berry-phase driven real-time dynamics of the charge flow induces a nonequilibrium orbital polarization. Through spin-orbit coupling, this orbital response is partially converted into spin polarization whose direction is determined by the current and chirality. On the analogy between the synthetic (1+1)- and 2-dimensional topological insulators, we suggest that non-trivial spin-orbital dynamics may accompany the anomalous quantum charge Hall states of even-dimensional real materials.

Abstract: We investigate the emergence and topological nature of interface states (IFs) in N-AGNR/$(N-2)$-AGNR/N-AGNR heterostructure (AGNRH) segments lacking translational symmetry, focusing on their relation to the end states (ESs) of the constituent armchair graphene nanoribbon (AGNR) segments. For AGNRs with $R_1$-type unit cells, the ES numbers under a longitudinal electric field follow the relations $N = N_{A(B)} \times 6 + 1$ and $N = N_{A(B)} \times 6 + 3$, whereas $R_2$-type unit cells exhibit $(N_{A(B)} + 1)$ ESs. The subscripts $A$ and $B$ denote the chirality types of the ESs. The Stark effect lifts ES degeneracy and enables clear spectral separation between ESs and IFs. Using a real-space bulk boundary perturbation approach, we show that opposite-chirality states hybridize through junction-site perturbations and may shift out of the bulk gap. The number and chirality of IFs in symmetric AGNRHs are determined by the difference between the ESs of the outer and central segments, $N_O$ and $N_C$, according to $N_{IF,β} = |N_{O,B(A)} - N_{C,A(B)}|$, where $β$ labels the chirality. Depending on whether $N_O > N_C$ or $N_C > N_O$, the resulting IFs acquire B- or A-chirality, respectively. Calculated transmission spectra ${\cal T}_{GNR}(\varepsilon)$ reveal that AGNRHs host a topological double quantum dot (TDQD) when IFs originate from the ESs of the central AGNR segment. Using an Anderson model with effective intra-dot and inter-dot Coulomb interactions, we derive an analytical expression for the tunneling current through the TDQD via a closed-form transmission coefficient. Thermoelectric analysis shows that TDQDs yield enhanced nonlinear power output in the electron-dilute and hole-dilute charge states, with Coulomb blockade suppressing thermal current but not thermal voltage.

Abstract: Non-Abelian topological charges (NATCs), characterized by their noncommutative algebra, offer a framework for describing multigap topological phases beyond conventional Abelian invariants. While higher-order topological phases (HOTPs) host boundary states at corners or hinges, their characterization has largely relied on Abelian invariants such as winding and Chern numbers. Here, we propose a coupled-wire scheme of constructing non-Abelian HOTPs and analyze a non-Abelian second-order topological insulator as its minimal model. The resulting Hamiltonian supports hybridized corner modes, protected by parity-time-reversal plus sublattice symmetries and described by a topological vector that unites a non-Abelian quaternion charge with an Abelian winding number. Corner states emerge only when both invariants are nontrivial, whereas weak topological edge states of non-Abelian origins arise when the quaternion charge is nontrivial, enriching the bulk-edge-corner correspondence. The system further exhibits both non-Abelian and Abelian topological phase transitions, providing a unified platform that bridges these two distinct topological classes. Our work extends the understanding of HOTPs into non-Abelian regimes and suggests feasible experimental realizations in synthetic quantum systems, such as photonic or acoustic metamaterials.

Abstract: A novel theoretical expression for the relaxation time of magnetic nanoparticles with dipolar interactions is derived from Kramers' theory, extending the Boltzmann-Gibbs framework to incorporate Tsallis statistics. The model provides, for the first time, a unified description of magnetic relaxation from weakly to strongly interacting regimes, culminating in a spin-glass transition. It accounts for both the decrease and increase of the relaxation time with growing dipolar coupling, a long-standing problem in nanoparticle magnetism, as classical phenomenological models fail to elucidate this transition. This result also offers an innovative interpretation of the cut-off temperature, $T_{cut-off}$, as a spin glass transition under the Tsallis distribution framework within the context of Néel-Brown's relaxation theory, thereby contributing to ongoing scientific discussions regarding this phenomenon.
