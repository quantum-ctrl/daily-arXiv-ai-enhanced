Abstract: Noncentrosymmetric superconductors (NCSs) with Rashba spin-orbit coupling
(SOC) and in-plane magnetic fields have emerged as natural platforms for
realizing both the bulk superconducting diode effect (SDE) and the Josephson
diode effect (JDE) - phenomena characterized by unequal critical currents in
opposite directions due to the simultaneous breaking of time-reversal and
inversion symmetries. Using the quasiclassical Eilenberger formalism, we
systematically investigate both the bulk SDE and the JDE in a clean NCS with
Rashba SOC and in-plane magnetic fields. For the bulk system, we find that the
diode efficiency can nominally approach its maximal value at the critical
endpoint of the first-order Lifshitz transition between weak and strong helical
phases featuring finite-momentum Cooper pairs, the latter marked by the
emergence of Bogolyubov Fermi surfaces (BFSs). In a Josephson junction, we show
that finite-momentum pairing in the superconducting leads is the dominant
mechanism behind the JDE in short junctions, whereas in long junctions it is
primarily governed by the Zeeman field in the normal region. In the
long-junction regime, the diode efficiency additionally oscillates between
positive and negative values as a function of magnetic field at low fields,
providing a route toward a highly tunable Josephson diode. At higher fields,
the onset of BFSs in the strong helical phase leads to a sharp suppression of
both the JDE and the Josephson current when the current direction is aligned
with momenta along the BFS, resulting in strong anisotropy. We propose that
this anisotropy in the Josephson current offers an alternative method for
detecting BFSs, applicable to systems with or without a JDE.

Abstract: Loop currents, as an orbital magnetism, have been proposed as a possible
fluctuation mechanism for superconducting pairing, which always remains
elusive. Here, we investigate the role of an interlayer loop current
fluctuation in mediating superconductivity using an unbiased bilayer
$t-J_{\perp}-V$ model via sign-problem-free projector quantum Monte Carlo
simulations. The model spontaneously generates the interlayer loop current by
breaking time-reversal and translational symmetries, favored by interlayer
Coulomb repusion. With hole doping, the loop current is rapidly suppressed,
while its fluctuations give rise to an interlayer $s$-wave superconductivity.
Our results establish a phase diagram to demonstrate a superconducting
transition due to the interlayer loop current fluctuations. It also provides
possible insights into some physics related to bilayer nickelates, with which
it shares a similar structure and a large interlayer spin exchange.

Abstract: Superconductors that can be mechanically exfoliated are an interesting
platform for exploring superconducting properties tuned by layer thickness.
These layered superconductors are also expected to exhibit sensitivity to
applied pressure. While pressure has been demonstrated to be an effective way
of tuning bulk superconductors, analogous studies on superconducting thin
flakes have been limited due to technical challenges. In particular,
spectroscopic measurements under pressure remain insufficiently explored. In
this work, we functionalized the diamond anvil cell technique for point-contact
Andreev reflection spectroscopy (PCAR) measurement on thin-flake materials
under pressure, offering the opportunity to obtain spectroscopic information on
superconductivity. To validate the feasibility of this method, we have
conducted PCAR measurements on iron-selenide thin flakes to extract
temperature-dependent superconducting gap values under ambient and high
pressure. Combine with the proven magnetotransport capability, our method
provides a conceptually simple tool for a detailed examination of thin-flake
superconductors under pressure.

Abstract: Charge-density-wave (CDW) order and superconductivity coexist in the kagome
metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=K, Cs, Rb), raising fundamental questions about the
mechanisms driving their intertwined phases. Here we combine high-resolution
inelastic X-ray scattering with first-principles calculations to uncover the
origin of CDW formation in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. Guided by structure factor analysis,
we identify a soft phonon mode along the reciprocal M-L direction, with the
strongest effect at the L point, where the elastic scattering intensity also
grows most rapidly upon cooling. First-principles calculations incorporating
lattice anharmonicity and electron-phonon coupling reproduce these observations
and establish a soft-mode instability at the L point as the driving mechanism
of CDW formation. Despite the weakly first-order character of the transition,
our results unambiguously demonstrate that the CDW in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ originates
from a softened phonon, clarifying its microscopic origin and highlighting the
central role of lattice dynamics in kagome metals.

Abstract: The magnetization field of a quantum Hall ferromagnet (QHFM) can host a
variety of spin textures, including skyrmions and magnons. When projected into
the lowest Landau level with $\nu = 1$ filling, the topological (Pontryagin)
charge density of the magnetization field is proportional to the electric
charge density, allowing for long-range spin-spin interactions. Inspired by
recent experimental developments that enable all-electrical magnon generation
and detection, in this work we theoretically demonstrate two phenomena that can
occur due to Coulomb interactions that are unique to QHFMs: magnons can scatter
off of point charges at a distance, and skyrmions can act as transmitters and
receivers for magnons to be transduced between separate layers of a bilayer
QHFM. The latter Coulomb-mediated spin drag effect occurs at arbitrary distance
and could facilitate long-range magnonics, such as detection of spin waves for
future experiments in 2D materials.

Abstract: Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) has established itself as a very
successful and reliable imaging and spectroscopic tool for measuring a wide
variety of nanoscale electromechanical functionalities. Quantitative imaging of
nanoscale electromechanical phenomena requires high sensitivity while avoiding
artifacts induced by large drive biases. Conventional PFM often relies on high
voltages to overcome optical detection noise, leading to various non-ideal
effects including electrostatic crosstalk, Joule heating, and tip-induced
switching. To mitigate this situation, we introduce interferometrically
detected, resonance-enhanced dual AC resonance tracking (iDART), which combines
femtometer-scale displacement sensitivity of quadrature phase differential
interferometry with contact resonance amplification. Through this combination,
iDART achieves 10x or greater signal-to-noise improvement over current state of
the art PFM approaches including both single frequency interferometric PFM or
conventional, resonance enhanced PFM using optical beam detection. In this
work, we demonstrate a >10x improvement of imaging sensitivity on PZT and
Y-HfO. Switching spectroscopy shows similar improvements, where further
demonstrates reliable hysteresis loops at small biases, mitigating
nonlinearities and device failures that can occur at higher excitation
amplitudes. These results position iDART as a powerful approach for probing
conventional ferroelectrics with extremely high signal to noise down to weak
piezoelectric systems, extending functional imaging capabilities to thin films,
2D ferroelectrics, beyond-CMOS technologies and bio-materials.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Many recent advances in our understanding of two-dimensional (2D) electron
systems stem from van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures. The assembly process
relies on the weak bonding across interfaces between layered vdW compounds,
making it possible to construct exceptionally clean heterostructures from
chemically and structurally distinct materials - a challenging task for
traditional thin-film growth techniques. Here we demonstrate an additional,
dynamic degree of freedom afforded by vdW interfaces, wherein we use
microstructured polymer stamps to disassemble and reconfigure vdW
heterostructures by sliding. We apply this technique to alter the dielectric
environment of monolayer graphene, perform scanning tunneling microscopy on
semiconducting and air-sensitive monolayers, and manipulate strain-sensitive
moir\'e materials. Together these demonstrations suggest a new paradigm for
assembling and dynamically modifying van der Waals heterostructures, with the
potential to reveal new insights into 2D electron systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: To achieve efficient anti-damping switching of nanoscale magnetic memories
with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy using spin-orbit torque requires that
the anti-damping spin-orbit torque have a strong out-of-plane component. The
spin anomalous Hall effect and the planar Hall effect spin current produced by
a ferromagnetic layer are candidate mechanisms for producing such an
out-of-plane anti-damping torque, but both require that the magnetic moment of
the spin source layer be canted partly out of the sample plane at zero applied
magnetic field. Here we demonstrate such a canted configuration for a
ferromagnetic SrRuO3 layer and we characterize all vector components of the
torque that it produces, including non-zero out-of-plane anti-damping torques.
We verify that the out-of-plane spin component can be tuned by the orientation
of magnetic moment, with significant contributions from both the spin anomalous
Hall effect and the planar Hall effect spin current.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: When monolayer graphene is crystallographically aligned to hexagonal boron
nitride (BN), a moir\'e superlattice is formed, producing characteristic
satellite Dirac peaks in the electronic band structure. Aligning a second BN
layer to graphene creates two coexisting moir\'e patterns, which can interfere
to produce periodic, quasi-periodic or non-periodic superlattices, depending on
their relative alignment. Here, we investigate one of the simplest realizations
of such a double-moir\'e structure, graphene encapsulated between two BN
layers, using dynamically rotatable van der Waals heterostructures. Our setup
allows \textit{in situ} control of the top BN alignment while keeping the
bottom BN fixed. By systematically mapping the charge transport as a function
of BN angular alignment, we identify the simultaneous signatures of the
original moir\'es, super-moir\'es, and a third set of features corresponding to
quasi-Brillouin zones (qBZ) formed when the system's periodicity becomes
ill-defined. Comparing our measurements with theoretical models, we provide the
first experimental mapping of the qBZs as a function of angular alignment. Our
results establish a direct experimental link between moir\'e interference and
qBZ formation, opening new avenues for engineering electronic structures in
multi-aligned 2D heterostructures.

Abstract: Large-scale simulations of light-matter interaction in natural photosynthetic
antenna complexes of the Chlorobium Tepidum green sulfur bacteria (GSB)
containing more than one hundred thousand chlorophyll molecules, comparable
with natural size, have been performed. Here we have modeled the entire process
of the exciton energy transfer, from sunlight absorption to exciton trapping in
the reaction centers (RCs) in presence of a thermal bath. The energy transfer
has been analyzed using the radiative non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and solving the
rate equations for the populations. Sunlight pumping has been modeled as
black-body radiation with an attenuation factor that takes the Sun-Earth
distance into account. Cylindrical structures typical of GSB antenna complexes,
and the dimeric baseplate comparable to natural size have been considered. Our
analysis shows that under natural sunlight, in photosynthetic antennae of GSB
the number of excitations reaching the RC per unit time matches the RC closure
rate and the internal efficiency shows values close to $\sim 80\%$. We also
considered cylindrical structures where the orientation of the dipoles does not
reflect the natural one. Specifically, we vary continuously the angle of the
transition dipole with respect to the cylinder main axis, focusing on the case
where all dipoles are parallel to the cylinder axis. We also consider the
important case where the dipoles are randomly oriented. In all cases the
light-harvesting efficiency is lower than in the natural structure, showing the
high sensitivity of light harvesting to the specific orientation of the dipole
moments. Our results allow for a better understanding of the relationship
between structure and functionality in photosynthetic antennae of GSB and could
drive the design of efficient light-harvesting devices.

Abstract: It is now known that in addition to electrons, other quasi-particles such as
phonons and magnons can also generate a thermal Hall signal. Graphite is a
semimetal with extremely mobile charge carriers of both signs and a large
lattice thermal conductivity. We present a study of the thermal Hall effect in
highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) samples with electronic, phononic and
phonon drag contributions to the thermal Hall signal. The measured thermal Hall
conductivity ($\kappa_{xy}$) is two orders of magnitude higher than what is
expected by electronic carriers according to the electrical Hall conductivity
and the Wiedemann-Franz law, yielding a record Hall Lorenz number of
$164.9\times10^{-8}V^2 K^{-2}$ ($\sim$67$L_0$) - the largest ever observed in a
metal. The temperature dependence of the thermal Hall conductivity
significantly differs from its longitudinal counterpart, ruling out a purely
phononic origin of the non-electronic component. Based on the temperature
dependence and the amplitudes of the Seebeck and Nernst responses, we
demonstrate that ambipolar phonon drag dominates the thermal Hall response of
graphite.

Abstract: Valley, as a ubiquitous degree of freedom in lattices, has found wide
applications in both electronic and classical-wave devices in recent years.
However, achieving valley-polarized states, a prerequisite for valley-based
operations, still remains challenging. Here, we propose and experimentally
demonstrate a universal non-Hermitian mechanism for valley filtering using only
uniform background dissipation, which creates a propagation length contrast
between valleys through their intrinsic group velocity differences. We
implement this concept in an acoustic crystal, observing switchable and robust
valley polarization of sound through large-scale field mapping. Remarkably, our
approach is solely based on uniform loss, without the need for any special
lattice structures, tailored excitations, or external fields. We further
provide designs of our non-Hermitian valley filter on photonic and electronic
platforms. Our results offer a simple and effective solution to
valley-polarized state generation and may advance the development of novel
valley-based devices in both classical and quantum regimes.

Abstract: The symmetry-broken correlated states in twisted double bilayer graphene
(TDBG) can be tuned via several external knobs, including twist angle,
displacement field, and carrier density. However, a direct, momentum-resolved
characterization of how these parameters reshape the flat-band structure
remains limited. In this study, we employ micro focused angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy to investigate the flat-band dispersion of TDBG at a
twist angle of 1.6, systematically varying the displacement field and carrier
density via electrostatic gating. We directly observe multiple flat moir'e
minibands near charge neutrality, including a flat remote valence band residing
below the low-energy flat-band manifold. Furthermore, the dominant Coulomb
repulsive energy over the flat- band bandwidth suggests favorable conditions
for the emergence of interaction-driven correlated phenomena in TDBG. These
findings establish that the formation and evolution of flat bands in TDBG
arises from the interplay between the electron filling and the displacement
field.

Abstract: We develop a unified, single-scale description of thermodynamics and quantum
oscillations in electronic systems with a uniform areal density of screw
dislocations under a uniform magnetic field. A single tunable gap,
$\hbar|\omega_{eff}|$ with $\omega_{eff}=\omega_{c}+\omega_{cl}$, organizes all
equilibrium observables obtained from a compact harmonic-oscillator partition
function: free energy, internal energy, entropy, heat capacity, magnetization,
magnetic susceptibility, and magnetocaloric responses collapse onto universal
hyperbolic kernels in $x=\hbar|\omega_{eff}|/(2k_{B}T)$. We identify a
compensated-field regime where the transverse gap closes and the heat capacity
reaches an equipartition plateau, providing a sharp signature of magnetoelastic
interference. In transport and torque, the same scale rigidly shifts the Hall
fan and compresses the $1/B$ period of de Haas-van Alphen and Shubnikov-de Haas
oscillations when expressed in $1/B_{eff}$, enabling a phase-unwarping protocol
that metrologizes the dislocation density from a single field sweep. In
mesoscopic samples, boundary corrections to the Landau degeneracy generate
finite-size calorimetric oscillations that diagnose the effective magnetic
length. Moderate disorder and weak interactions preserve the kernel structure
while smoothing amplitudes. We outline an experimental roadmap combining
on-chip calorimetry, torque magnetometry, and transport, and discuss
device-level opportunities in caloritronics and strain engineering,
magnetocaloric microcooling, magnetoelastic heat switching, and dilatometric
transduction, where the single scale $\hbar|\omega_{eff}|$ enables rational
design and optimization.

Abstract: We introduce a universal theory of phase auto-oscillators driven by a bi
harmonic signal (having frequency components close to single and double of the
free-running oscillator frequency) with noise. With it, we show how
deterministic phase locking and stochastic phase slips can be continuously
tuned by varying the relative amplitudes and frequencies of the driving
components. Using, as an example, a spin-torque nano-oscillator, we numerically
validate this theory by implementing a deterministic Ising machine paradigm, a
probabilistic one, and dual-mode operation of the two. This demonstration
introduces the concept of adaptive Ising machines (AIM), a unified
oscillator-based architecture that dynamically combines both regimes within the
same hardware platform by properly tuning the amplitudes of the bi-harmonic
driving relative to the noise strength. Benchmarking on different classes of
combinatorial optimization problems, the AIM exhibits complementary performance
compared to oscillator based Ising machines and probabilistic Ising machines,
with adaptability to the specific problem class. This work introduces the first
OIM capable of transitioning between deterministic and probabilistic
computation taking advantage of a proper design of the trade-off between the
strength of phase-locking of an auto-oscillator to a bi harmonic external
driving and noise, opening a path toward scalable, CMOS compatible hardware for
hybrid optimization and inference.

Abstract: We show that rolling a two-dimensional altermagnet into a nanotube turns it
into a spin-programmable chiral nanosolenoid with two reciprocal, SOC-free
functionalities. (i) Direct: injecting a single-spin-polarized current produces
a steady helical current whose handedness is locked to the spin orientation,
yielding opposite axial magnetic fields for opposite spins. (ii) Inverse: a
time-varying axial flux Phi(t) induces a circumferential Faraday field E_theta
= -(dPhi/dt)/(2 pi R) that drives equal-magnitude, opposite-sign axial charge
currents in the two spin channels, Iz^up = - Iz^down, thereby pumping a pure
spin current Is = (hbar/2e)(Iz^up - Iz^down) with zero net charge flow. Both
effects arise from the interplay between momentum-odd spin polarization
inherent to altermagnets and the screw symmetry of the rolled geometry, and
persist in the complete absence of spin-orbit coupling. Using V2Se2O as a
prototype, first-principles calculations reveal spin-dependent chiral wave
functions near both the conduction- and valence-band edges. These results
establish a nonrelativistic route toward compact spin-controlled flux
generators and charge-neutral spin injectors in light-element materials without
static magnetic bias.

Abstract: Antiperovskite derivatives have emerged as promising candidates for
optoelectronic applications. However, due to the significant computational
cost, their excitonic and polaronic properties remain underexplored despite
being critical for optoelectronic performance. Here, we present the structural,
electronic, optical, excitonic, and polaronic properties of a series of
antiperovskite derivatives with the chemical formula X$_{3}$BI$_{3}$ (X = Ca,
Sr; B = P, As, Sb, Bi) using state-of-the-art first-principles calculations.
All the compounds exhibit direct bandgaps with G$_{0}$W$_{0}$@PBE bandgap
ranging from 2.42 to 3.02 eV, optimal for efficient light absorption with
minimal energy loss. Exciton binding energies (0.258-0.318 eV) indicate
moderate Coulomb attraction, favoring exciton dissociation. Employing the
Feynman polaron model, we established the polaronic properties, where weak to
intermediate carrier-phonon coupling was observed, with polaron mobilities
reaching values up to 37.19 cm$^{2}$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$. These properties
establish X$_{3}$BI$_{3}$ materials as viable candidates for next-generation
optoelectronic devices.

Abstract: We employ first-principles density-functional theory to investigate the
structural, thermodynamic, electronic, and topological properties of tellurium
in its various dimensional forms: bulk trigonal tellurium (Te-I),
two-dimensional (2D) monolayers $\alpha$-Te, $\beta$-Te and one-dimensional
helical nanowire (Te-h). A softening of the acoustic phonon modes is seen in
most of the 2D phases, suggesting a tendency to structural distortions or phase
transitions under small perturbations. The trigonal 3D Te-I structure is
characterized as a narrow-gap semiconductor hosting Weyl nodes at high-symmetry
locations in the Brillouin zone, which is supported by the characteristic spin
texture seen in momentum space, where spins align radially, forming Berry
monopoles. This topological feature, along with the observation of Weyl phonons
is attributed to inversion symmetry breaking and strong SOC. Ultrathin Te-h
nanowires also exhibit signatures of Weyl nodes and presents a considerable
energy gap under SOC. On the other hand, the two-dimensional monolayers
$\alpha$-Te, $\beta$-Te, are classified as topologically trivial, as indicated
by their topological invariants, which arises from the preservation of both
spatial inversion and time-reversal symmetries in these systems. The potential
for inducing topological phase transitions via external perturbations suggest
that these monolayers are promising candidates for engineered Weyl phases or
other topological states. We demonstrate that tellurium and its low-dimensional
derivatives are versatile materials that exhibit a broad range of electronic
and phononic phenomena intrinsically linked to chirality and symmetry breaking.
The tunability of their electronic and topological properties places tellurium
as a promising material platform for the exploration and application of Weyl
physics in next-generation electronic and optoelectronic technologies.

Abstract: NbOI$_2$ has recently emerged as a new van der Waals material combining
semiconducting behavior with intrinsic in plane ferroelectricity and pronounced
transport and optical anisotropy. However, its photocarrier dynamics remain
largely unexplored. Here we report transient absorption spectroscopy of
NbOI$_2$ using femtosecond pump probe reflectance measurements. A pronounced
transient absorption feature is observed near the 2.34 eV excitonic resonance,
arising from photocarrier induced excitonic energy shifts and saturation. The
decay dynamics reveal an exciton lifetime of several tens of picoseconds and
show density-dependent behavior consistent with exciton exciton annihilation,
yielding an annihilation coefficient of 0.09 cm$^2$ s$^{-1}$, which is
comparable to that in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides. Polarization
resolved measurements further reveal a pronounced in-plane anisotropy in the
transient response that follows the linear absorption anisotropy. These
findings provide fundamental insight into photocarrier dynamics in NbOI$_2$ and
establish key parameters for understanding and exploiting its optoelectronic
behavior.

Abstract: Altermagnets have attracted considerable interest for their capacity to
generate spin splitting while preserving zero net magnetization. This work
proposes a distinct class of antiferromagnetic materials, termed X-type
antiferromagnets, which are shown to produce more efficient $\cal T$-odd spin
currents than altermagnets along specific crystallographic directions due to
their unique Fermi surface geometry. The spin current polarization is
controlled by the N\'eel vector orientation. In the (110)-oriented
$\beta-\mathrm{Fe}_2\mathrm{PO}_5$, the Fermi surface exhibits a $d$-wave
altermagnetic-like characteristic and becomes compressed into an approximately
X-shaped $d$-wave configuration, yielding highly efficient $\cal T$-odd spin
currents with a charge-to-spin conversion efficiency reaching 90%. Moreover,
when the N\'eel vector is tilted via unit cell selection or external means, the
system generates out-of-plane spin-polarized currents with efficiencies
substantially exceeding those of known ferromagnets, altermagnets, noncollinear
antiferromagnets, and low-symmetry materials. The highly efficient charge-spin
conversion in X-type antiferromagnets provides a novel and highly effective
spin source system for the development of low-power spintronic devices.

Abstract: Predicting which hypothetical inorganic crystals can be experimentally
realized remains a central challenge in accelerating materials discovery.
SyntheFormer is a positive-unlabeled framework that learns synthesizability
directly from crystal structure, combining a Fourier-transformed crystal
periodicity (FTCP) representation with hierarchical feature extraction,
Random-Forest feature selection, and a compact deep MLP classifier. The model
is trained on historical data from 2011 through 2018 and evaluated
prospectively on future years from 2019 to 2025, where the positive class
constitutes only 1.02 per cent of samples. Under this temporally separated
evaluation, SyntheFormer achieves a test area under the ROC curve of 0.735 and,
with dual-threshold calibration, attains high-recall screening with 97.6 per
cent recall at 94.2 per cent coverage, which minimizes missed opportunities
while preserving discriminative power. Crucially, the model recovers
experimentally confirmed metastable compounds that lie far from the convex hull
and simultaneously assigns low scores to many thermodynamically stable yet
unsynthesized candidates, demonstrating that stability alone is insufficient to
predict experimental attainability. By aligning structure-aware representation
with uncertainty-aware decision rules, SyntheFormer provides a practical route
to prioritize synthesis targets and focus laboratory effort on the most
promising new inorganic materials.

Abstract: Owing to their small binding energies, excitons in bulk semiconductors
typically exhibit a sharp optical peak at low temperatures only. This
limitation can be overcome by single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and other
low-dimensional semiconductors with highly enhanced exciton binding energies.
Exciton thermal radiation, which can potentially be exploited for selective
thermal emission and energy harvesting, has been recently observed in
individual SWCNTs heated under photoirradiation. However, whether
macroscale-SWCNT assemblies can emit exciton thermal radiation under conduction
heating remains unclear and constitutes an important challenge for practical
applications. Herein, we observed peaked exciton thermal radiation from
structure-sorted SWCNT membranes. Transmission spectroscopy showed robust
exciton resonance at high temperatures, resulting in clear exciton resonance in
the thermal radiation band. The absolute emissivity spectra of the membranes
were determined at 850 K. Exciton dominance suppresses the contribution of
thermal free carriers to the infrared absorption/emission spectra, maintaining
the transparency below the optical gap even at elevated temperatures. These
phenomena are not observed in bulk semiconductors, highlighting the
structure-sorted SWCNT membranes as unique semiconductors leveraging stable
exciton resonances at elevated temperatures.

Abstract: Multiferroic materials, particularly rare-earth orthochromates (RECrO$_3$),
have garnered significant interest due to their unique magnetic and
electric-polar properties, making them promising candidates for multifunctional
devices. Although extensive research has been conducted on their
antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition temperature (N$\acute{\textrm{e}}$el
temperature, $T_\textrm{N}$), ferroelectricity, and piezoelectricity, the
effects of doping and substitution of rare-earth (RE) elements on these
properties remain insufficiently explored. In this study, convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) were employed to predict and analyze the physical properties of
RECrO$_3$ compounds under various doping scenarios. Experimental and literature
data were integrated to train machine learning models, enabling accurate
predictions of $T_\textrm{N}$, besides remanent polarization ($P_\textrm{r}$)
and piezoelectric coefficients ($d_{33}$). The results indicate that doping
with specific RE elements significantly impacts $T_\textrm{N}$, with optimal
doping levels identified for enhanced performance. Furthermore, high-entropy
RECrO$_3$ compounds were systematically analyzed, demonstrating how the
inclusion of multiple RE elements influences magnetic properties. This work
establishes a robust framework for predicting and optimizing the properties of
RECrO$_3$ materials, offering valuable insights into their potential
applications in energy storage and sensor technologies.

Abstract: The initialization and control of a long-lived spin population in lead halide
perovskites are prerequisites for their use in spintronic applications. Here,
we demonstrate circular polarization of the interlayer exciton emission in a
(BA)2PbI4/WSe2 monolayer heterostructure. The helicity of this emission is
controlled by tuning the energy of the excitation laser through the manifold of
exciton resonances of the WSe2 monolayer, together with an emerging interlayer
absorption feature of the heterostructure. Theoretical calculations show that
this resonance arises from hybridized (BA)2PbI4/WSe2 states in the valence
band. This hybrid character enables its observation in both linear absorption
and ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopies, and plays a key role in controlling
the sign of the helicity of the interlayer exciton emission. The tunable spin
polarization demonstrated here, with the WSe2 monolayer effectively acting as a
tunable spin filter, represents an important step toward the use of 2D
perovskites in opto-spintronic applications.

Abstract: Photocatalytic hydrogen (H2) production and carbon dioxide (CO2) conversion
to methane (CH4) are considered promising solutions for reducing CO2 emissions.
However, the development of highly active photocatalysts is essential to
efficiently drive these reactions without harming the environment. In this
study, we introduce a strategy that incorporates elements with both low and
high electronegativities into catalysts based on transition metals, thereby
enhancing both reactant adsorption and charge transfer. This strategy is
implemented in a high-entropy oxide (HEO) by adding cesium, an alkali metal
with very low electronegativity, and gallium, a metal with high
electronegativity, to transition metals titanium, niobium and tantalum. The
resulting oxide, TiNbTaGaCsO9 with a large concentration of oxygen vacancies,
exhibits strong light absorption, a low bandgap and a suitable band structure
for both hydrogen evolution and CO2 conversion. Compared to HEOs with only d0
or d0+d10 cationic configurations, the synthesized oxide with a wide
electronegativity difference and mixed d0+d10+s0 cationic configurations shows
significantly higher activity for both H2 and CH4 production, even without
using a cocatalyst. These results demonstrate a design strategy for creating
highly active HEOs containing alkali metals by taking advantage of the
electronegativity mismatch across the periodic table.

Abstract: The theory of the intrinsic Hall effect, both linear and nonlinear, is rooted
in a geometry which is defined in the Bloch-vector parameter space; the formal
expressions are mostly derived from semiclassical concepts. When disorder and
interaction are considered there is no Bloch vector to speak of; one needs a
more general quantum geometry, defined in a different parameter space. Such
higher-level geometrical formulation of the intrinsic Hall effect provides very
compact expressions, which have the additional virtue -- in the Bloch special
case -- of yielding the known results in a straightforward way: the logic is
not concealed by the algebra.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) bilayers with an interlayer twist
exhibit a moire super-period, whose effects can manifest in both structural and
electronic properties. Atomic displacements can lead to reconstruction into
domains of aligned stacking, and flat bands can form that may host correlated
electron states. In heterobilayers angular mismatch is nearly unavoidable, so
understanding the consequences of an interlayer twist is essential. Using ab
initio density functional theory, we find that in near-60 degree twisted
MoSe2/WSe2 bilayers valence and conduction band flat bands emerge at ~3 degree
twist. Despite relatively limited reconstruction at these angles, atomic
displacement creates a polarization gradient that forms a confining potential,
localizing and laterally separating electrons and holes within the moire
supercell. Excitons formed from flat band electrons and holes should therefore
have not only the out-of-plane dipole moment familiar from MoSe2/WSe2
interlayer excitons, but an in-plane dipole moment as well.

Abstract: This research establishes a systematic, high-throughput computational
framework for designing radiation-resistant, dilute ternary copper-based alloys
by addition of solutes that bind to vacancies and reduce their mobility, thus
promoting interstitial-vacancy recombination. The first challenge in developing
alloys by this method is mitigating the vacancy-mediated solute drag effect,
since density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that solutes that bind
strongly to vacancies are also rapidly dragged to point-defect sinks, and thus
removed from the matrix. To overcome this issue, two types of solutes are added
to the Cu matrix: A first solute with a strong vacancy binding energy (B-type
species) and another solute that binds to 'B' and is a slow diffuser in Cu
(C-type species). Using DFT, 21 synergistic solute pairs are screened, with
'B'=Zr, Ge, Sn and 'C'=Fe, Co, Mo, Ni, Nb, W, Cr. Two promising alloys,
Cu(Zr,Co) and Cu(Zr,Fe) are then investigated in detail in the dilute regime.
Diffusion and solute drag in these alloys are modeled using the kinetic cluster
expansion approach (KineCluE) under irradiation conditions. It is shown that
strong Zr-'C' thermodynamic binding, especially between Zr and Co,
significantly reduces the mobility of Zr solute and suppresses the
vacancy-mediated solute drag. Using an analytical framework for the standard
five-jump frequency model for diffusion in binary alloys, it is found that
vacancy-Zr-Co triplets disrupt the kinetic circuits that promote solute drag in
the binary alloy by raising the dissociation barrier for the vacancy from the
solute.

Abstract: Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) is a foundational technique for characterizing
crystalline materials. However, the reliable interpretation of XRD patterns,
particularly in multiphase systems, remains a manual and expertise-demanding
task. As a characterization method that only provides structural information,
multiple reference phases can often be fit to a single pattern, leading to
potential misinterpretation when alternative solutions are overlooked. To ease
humans' efforts and address the challenge, we introduce Dara (Data-driven
Automated Rietveld Analysis), a framework designed to automate the robust
identification and refinement of multiple phases from powder XRD data. Dara
performs an exhaustive tree search over all plausible phase combinations within
a given chemical space and validates each hypothesis using a robust Rietveld
refinement routine (BGMN). Key features include structural database filtering,
automatic clustering of isostructural phases during tree expansion,
peak-matching-based scoring to identify promising phases for refinement. When
ambiguity exists, Dara generates multiple hypothesis which can then be decided
between by human experts or with further characteriztion tools. By enhancing
the reliability and accuracy of phase identification, Dara enables scalable
analysis of realistic complex XRD patterns and provides a foundation for
integration into multimodal characterization workflows, moving toward fully
self-driving materials discovery.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success in increasing the efficiency and stability of
perovskite solar cells over the last decade, the underlying defect landscape of
halide perovskites remains unclear. Some charged defects in perovskites migrate
in response to an applied electric field, which complicates their
characterization with standard techniques. We combine thermal admittance
spectroscopy (TAS) with lateral photoconductivity-based methods, such as the
thermal steady-state photocurrent (SSPC) and the steady-state photocarrier
grating (SSPG), to estimate the kinetic and electrical properties of defects in
thin films of vacuum-deposited FA$_{0.7}$Cs$_{0.3}$Pb(I$_{0.9}$Br$_{0.1}$)$_3$
perovskite. The experimental results are consistent with exponential band tails
states coming from the lattice disorder, an acceptor-like Gaussian distribution
0.21~eV below the conduction band and approximately equal concentrations of
donors and acceptors ($1.7\times10^{17}$ cm$^{-3}$). One of the dopants has

nickel and silicon-oxygen systems, it yields models up to seven times faster
than standard MTPs. The method requires no new data and remains fully

Abstract: Herein, we conduct a comprehensive investigation of Hexa-graphyne (HXGY), a
planar carbon allotrope formed by distorted hexagonal and rectangular rings
incorporating sp and sp$^2$-hybridized carbon atoms. First-principles
calculations confirm its energetic, dynamical and thermal stability (up to at
least 1000 K). Regarding its band structure, this material exhibits a
semimetallic nature. It exhibits high mechanical compliance, with a Young's
modulus approximately 13 times lower and a Poisson's ratio nearly 4 times
higher than those of graphene. The optical response is marked by strong
ultraviolet absorption, high infrared reflectivity, and pronounced transparency
in the visible-light range. Raman and infrared spectra exhibit sharp and
well-separated peaks, providing a clear signature of acetylenic linkage
stretching vibrations. Nanoribbon structures derived from HXGY show distinct
electronic behaviors depending on the edge termination type and width. These
findings highlight the HXGY potential for nanoelectronic and optoelectronic
applications.
