These phases form a cascade of chiral topological states with different angular momenta, where the order-parameter phase winds by $2\u03c0m$ around the Fermi surface, with $m = 1,3,5,\\ldots$, and the succession of phases is governed by the Berry-curvature flux through the Fermi surface area, $\u03a6= b k_F^2/2$. As $\u03a6$ increases, the system undergoes a sequence of first-order phase transitions between distinct chiral phases, occurring whenever $\u03a6$ crosses integer values.

Understanding the nature and origins of these discrete charge fluctuations may provide insights into material improvements or means of mitigating charge noise in semiconductor quantum dot devices. In this work, we measure multi-level charge fluctuations present in a Si/SiGe double quantum dot device over a range of device operating voltages and temperatures. To characterize the parameter-dependent dynamics of the underlying fluctuating degrees of freedom, we perform a detailed analysis of the measured noise timeseries. We perform algorithmically assisted drift detection and change point detection to detrend the data and remove a slow fluctuator component, as a preprocessing step. We perform model comparison on the post-processed time series between different $n$-level fluctuator ($n$LF) factorial hidden Markov models (FHMMs), finding that although at most sweep values the independent pair of 2LFs model would be preferred, in a particular region of voltage space the 4LF model outperforms the other models, indicating a conditional rate dependence between the two fluctuators. By tracking fluctuator transition rates, biases, and weights over a range of different device configurations, we estimate gate voltage and conductivity sensitivity. In particular, we fit a phenomenological, detailed balance model to the extracted independent 2LFs rate data, yielding lever arm estimates in the range of $-2 \u03bc$eV/mV up to $4 \u03bc$eV/mV between the two 2LFs and nearby gate electrodes.

So far, the study of these and other 3D nanostructures is usually confined to a limited number of magnetic microscopy experiments in large facilities. Here, we investigate the reversal mechanism of a single DH nanowire using Dark-Field magneto-optical Kerr effect (DF-MOKE) magnetometry under external 3D magnetic fields. By analyzing the angular dependence of the DF-MOKE signal, we fit the reversal process using established models for domain-wall nucleation and propagation, finding a characteristic behavior similar to that reported for cylindrical nanowires. Micromagnetic simulations indicate that the reversal process goes through nucleation of the helical vortex tube in a curling manner while ptychographic X-ray magnetic circular dichroism data reveal that this helical vortex tube state forms through a mixed nucleation-propagation process. These observations provide a consistent microscopic picture of reversal mediated by a helical vortex tube extending along the nanowire. Our work provides a comprehensive characterization of magnetization reversal in DH nanowires and demonstrates that DF-MOKE magnetometry is effective for probing reversal mechanisms in single 3D nanostructures.

Surface chemistry and topography were characterized using X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), followed by sliding bandpass filtration and multiscale curvature tensor-based methods to measure scale-dependent topographic features. Macrophage response and biofilm growth were assessed by fluorescence microscopy. Correlation strength showed scale-dependence with respect to surface features and biological structure: individual bacteria and small colonies correlated more strongly with fine-scale topographic features, whereas macrophage morphology correlated more strongly with larger-scale surface features. Notably, measured surface chemical descriptors generally did not correlate strongly with biofilm formation; nonetheless, chitosan and silk fibroin showed distinct trends in bacterial support, suggesting that material identity was not captured by the measured surface properties and that prevention of biofilms likely benefits from combinatorial approaches as opposed to physical surface modification alone. These results show that different biological structures interact with material surfaces at distinct length scales, as well as demonstrate the utility of multiscale analysis in identifying scales of interest in biological interactions with surfaces.

Fonseca"], "title": "Effect of Interatomic Potential Choice on Fracture Modes of Graphene with Parallel Cracks", "comment": "12 pages, 4 figures", "summary": "Defect engineering via parallel cracks has been proposed as a route to tailor the fracture response of graphene. However, atomistic fracture predictions can be strongly sensitive to the interatomic potential. Here, we quantify the effect of potential choice by revisiting H-passivated graphene containing two parallel cracks separated by a gap $W_{\\text{gap}}$ loaded in tension along the armchair (AC) and zigzag (ZZ) directions. Molecular dynamics simulations using the AIREBO potential under the same geometry and loading protocol previously studied with ReaxFF, are employed, so enabling a direct comparison. Stress-strain responses, Young's modulus, an effective mode-I stress intensity factor, and energy absorption are evaluated as functions of $W_{\\text{gap}}$. Compared with ReaxFF, AIREBO predicts lower peak stresses and earlier catastrophic softening, leading to reduced post-peak deformation capacity and energy absorption. Ductility and energy absorption are shown to be highly potential-dependent, underscoring the need for careful potential selection in defect-engineered graphene fracture simulations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this work, we employ a multiscale Spin-Lattice Dynamics (SLD) approach to investigate the magnetostructural correlations in amorphous Co$_{x}$Fe$_{1-x}$ nanodisks ($x=35, 50, 65$). By integrating classical molecular dynamics with a generalized magnetic Hamiltonian, we capture the dynamic feedback loop between lattice vibrations and spin precession. Topological analysis via Voronoi tessellation reveals a persistent species-dependent structural heterogeneity: Cobalt atoms preferentially adopt \"solid-like\" icosahedral packing, forming a rigid structural backbone, whereas Iron atoms exhibit a higher propensity for \"liquid-like\" disordered environments. We demonstrate that this topological disparity dictates the macroscopic magnetic response. The Cobalt-driven structural stiffness preserves a robust exchange network that maximizes saturation magnetization, while the local disorder inherent to Iron-rich regions introduces exchange fluctuations that act as an intrinsic damping mechanism, delaying magnetic relaxation. These findings provide an atomistic explanation for the stability of ferromagnetic order in Co-Fe metallic glasses and offer a pathway for tuning damping parameters in amorphous spintronic devices through stoichiometric control.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While most of TMDCs are intrinsic n-type semiconductors due to electron donation from chalcogen vacancies, realizing intrinsic p-type TMDCs and achieving precise control over their electronic properties remain challenging. In this work, we introduce a powerful approach to obtain intrinsic hole doping by substituting Ta atom into 2H-WSe2. A combining study of molecular beam epitaxy growth and in-situ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy characterization clearly reveals that Ta substitution induces a significant hole doping and provides a possible way of a semiconductor-to-metal transition in 2H-WSe2.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

They are grown by plasma-activated molecular beam epitaxy, varying either the nominal thickness or the gallium-to-nitrogen flux ratio. In situ monitoring reveals difference in 2D nucleation and step-flow growth modes of the QWs. The emission charactestics of QWs with integer thicknesses of 1 and 2 MLs depend weakly on the growth mechanism. In contrast, the intensity and spectral position luminescence of QWs with fractional-ML thicknesses are determined by the growth mechanism. Using ab initio calculations, a phenomenological model is proposed that describes fractional-ML QWs either as arrays of 2D quantum disks or as arrays of 2D quantum ribbons, in cases where 2D nucleation or step-flow growth mechanisms predominate, respectively. This model is generally consistent with experimental data on photo- and cathodoluminescence of heterostructures with multiple (250) GaN/AlN QWs. These heterostructures, when pumped by electrom beam at an energy 12.5 keV with a maximum pulse current of 2 A, exhibit linear current dependences of optical peak powers up to 1 and 37 W for wavelengths of 228 and 256 nm, respectively, making them promising for use as powerfull ultraviolet-C emitters.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In particular, we derive a cyclic- and helical-symmetry-adapted representation of the dynamical matrix at arbitrary phonon wavevectors within a variationally formulated, symmetry-adapted density functional perturbation theory framework. In so doing, we also derive the acoustic sum rules for cylindrical geometries, which include a rigid-body rotational mode in addition to the three translational modes. We implement the cyclic- and helical-symmetry-adapted formalism within a high-order finite-difference discretization. Using carbon nanotubes as representative systems, we demonstrate the accuracy of the framework through excellent agreement with periodic plane-wave results. We further apply the framework to compute the Young's and shear moduli of carbon nanotubes, as well as the scaling laws governing the dependence of ring and radial breathing mode phonon frequencies on nanotube diameter. The elastic moduli are found to be in agreement with previous density functional theory and experimental results, while the phonon scaling laws show qualitative agreement with previous atomistic simulations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
