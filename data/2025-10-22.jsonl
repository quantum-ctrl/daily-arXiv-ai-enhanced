While recent deep learning models have made\nbreakthroughs in solving the crystallographic phase problem, the resulting\nlow-resolution electron density maps are often ambiguous and difficult to\ninterpret. To overcome this critical bottleneck, we introduce XDXD, to our\nknowledge, the first end-to-end deep learning framework to determine a complete\natomic model directly from low-resolution single-crystal X-ray diffraction\ndata. Our diffusion-based generative model bypasses the need for manual map\ninterpretation, producing chemically plausible crystal structures conditioned\non the diffraction pattern. We demonstrate that XDXD achieves a 70.4\\% match\nrate for structures with data limited to 2.0~\\AA{} resolution, with a\nroot-mean-square error (RMSE) below 0.05. Evaluated on a benchmark of 24,000\nexperimental structures, our model proves to be robust and accurate.\nFurthermore, a case study on small peptides highlights the model's potential\nfor extension to more complex systems, paving the way for automated structure\nsolution in previously intractable cases."}

However, its\ncommand-line operation and input file preparation often present a steep\nlearning curve, particularly for students and researchers without programming\nexperience. To lower these barriers, we have developed SimplySQS\n(simplysqs.com), an online, browser-based interactive interface that automates\nthe preparation, execution, and analysis of ATAT mcsqs outputs. SimplySQS\nallows users to upload or import structures from databases (MP, AFLOW, COD),\nconfigure compositions and supercells via guided forms, automatically generate\nATAT input and batch scripts, and visualize results such as convergence\nbehavior, correlation functions, and radial distribution functions. The best\nSQS outputs can be exported in standard formats (POSCAR, CIF, LMP, XYZ). By\nsimplifying setup and minimizing file-handling errors, SimplySQS broadens\naccess to ATAT mcsqs, making SQS generation more approachable for beginners\nwhile streamlining workflows for experienced users. The workflow is illustrated\non the perovskite series Pb1-xSrxTiO3 (PSTO, including PbTiO3 (PTO) and SrTiO3\n(STO)), where an all-in-one batch script generated with SimplySQS was used to\nobtain SQSs across the composition range.

The conventional theory of\nsuperconductivity developed in 1957 is generally believed to fully explain the\nMeissner effect.

However, recent work has shown that there\nare questions related to momentum conservation in the process of magnetic field\nexpulsion that have not been addressed within the conventional theory.

This is consistent with the behavior of classical plasmas, where\nmotion of magnetic field lines is always associated with motion of charges. We\nreview how this approach explains puzzles associated with momentum transfer\nbetween electrons and ions in the Meissner effect. Whether or not radial charge\nmotion is associated with the Meissner effect has fundamental implications\nregarding superconductivity mechanisms in materials and regarding strategies to\nsearch for new materials with higher superconducting transition temperatures.\nTherefore, adjudication of this question is urgent and important."}

This effect can be achieved for skyrmions moving in a\nchannel with a sawtooth potential on one side and a reversed sawtooth potential\non the other side. We consider the cases of both spin-transfer torque (STT) and\nspin-orbit torque (SOT) driving. When the magnetic field is held fixed, the\nvelocity response of the skyrmion is the same for current applied in either\ndirection for both STT and SOT driving, so there is no current diode effect.\nWhen the magnetic field is reversed, under STT driving the velocity of the\nskyrmion reverses and its absolute value changes. Under SOT driving, the\nvelocity remains in the same direction but drops to a much lower value,\nresulting in negative differential conductivity. For a fixed current, we find a\nnonreciprocal skyrmion velocity as a function of positive and negative applied\nfields, in analogy to the velocity-current curves observed in the usual diode\neffect. The nonreciprocity is generated by the Magnus force, which causes\nskyrmions to interact preferentially with one side of the channel. Since the\nchannel sides have opposite asymmetry, a positive magnetic field can cause the\nskyrmion to interact with the \"hard\" asymmetry side of the channel, while a\nnegative magnetic field causes the skyrmion to interact with the easy asymmetry\nside.

A\nprotocol to assess the spin-filtering capacity of 5-zWXYNR + nad as a function\nof the nature and the density of atomic adsorbates, is formulated in terms of\nband structure analysis of the respective electrode units. Spin gaps emerging\nclose to the Fermi energy of the electrode are shown to provide an effective\npredictor for the degree of current spin polarization achieved by any of the\ntransmission systems studied here. For any adsorbate configuration considered,\nferromagnetic (FM) as well as antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering is examined, and\nthe impact of the magnetic phase on the spin transport properties is discussed.\nA spin-selective negative differential resistance effect is identified for\nspecific nanoribbon systems."}

The light fields can\ntransiently dress Bloch electrons, creating novel electronic states\ninaccessible in equilibrium. While such temporal modulation provides dynamic\ncontrol, spatially periodic modulations, such as those arising from charge\ndensity wave (CDW) order, can also dramatically reconstruct the band structure\nthrough real-space symmetry breaking. The interplay between these two distinct\nforms of modulation-temporal and spatial-opens a new frontier in\nelectronic-phase-dependent Floquet engineering. Here we demonstrate this\nconcept experimentally in the prototypical CDW material 1T-TiSe$_2$. Using\ntime- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (TrARPES) with mid-infrared\npumping, we observe a striking pump-induced instantaneous downshift of the\nvalence band maximum (VBM), which is in sharp contrast to the subsequent upward\nshift on picosecond timescale associated with CDW melting. Most remarkably, the\nlight-induced VBM downshift is observed exclusively in the CDW phase and only\nwhen the pump pulse is present, reaching maximum when pumping near resonance\nwith the CDW gap. These observations unequivocally reveal the critical role of\nCDW in the Floquet engineering of TiSe$_2$.
