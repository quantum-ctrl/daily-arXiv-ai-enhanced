Abstract: Despite the well-established presence of amorphous compounds on planetary
bodies such as the Moon and Mercury due to space weathering, the direct effect
of atomic arrangement on the surface binding energies (SBEs) of elements on
these bodies remains largely unexplored. Accurate SBE values are essential for
reliably predicting sputtering yields and the energy distribution of ejecta.
Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations to quantify SBEs for the different
elements sputtered from amorphous atomic arrangements of the plagioclase
feldspar end members, albite and anorthite, and compare to their crystalline
counterparts. Results show that while the mean elemental SBEs from amorphous
surfaces are not significantly different from their crystalline counterparts,
the random orientation in amorphous structures gives rise to a spectrum of
bonding configurations, resulting in a distribution of SBEs with a wider range.
This contrasts with the clearly discretized set of SBE values associated with
the ordered atomic structure of crystalline surfaces. We then consider
sputtering by H, He, and a solar wind combination of 96% H and 4% He. For each
of these cases, we demonstrate that there is minimal difference (<10% for
albite and <20% for anorthite) between the sputtering yields of amorphous and
crystalline surfaces. We attribute these results to the presence of the same
elemental bonds across different atomic arrangements, which leads to similar
mean SBEs and, consequently, comparable sputtering yields.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Chromium thin films deposited on silicon substrates by DC magnetron
sputtering were systematically investigated as a function of film thickness,
using a DC power of 50 W and a post-deposition annealing temperature of 200 C.
Two types of grounded substrate holders, copper and stainless steel, were
employed to assess substrate-dependent effects. The intrinsic stress,
determined by the wafer curvature method, decreases with increasing film
thickness but increases with the annealing temperature. It is observed that for
thinner as-deposited chromium films, the stress showed a pronounced
irreversible increase when measured immediately after deposition and after
several days of aging. Films deposited on copper holders consistently exhibited
higher stress values than those grown on stainless steel holders. These
observations suggest that the intrinsic stress in as-deposited films is linked
to the growth mechanism, while the stress increase after annealing may be
related to thermally active diffusion and structural relaxation. The higher
stress in films grown on copper substrate holder can likely be associated with
enhanced ion bombardment due to the higher electrical conductivity of copper.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The magnetic anisotropy of amorphous NdCo$_{4.6}$ compounds deposited by
magnetron sputtering change with film thickness from in plane to out of plane
anisotropy at thickness above 40 nm. Xray reflectivity measurements shows the
progressive formation of an additional layer in between the 3 nm thick Si
capping layer and the NdCo compound film. Hard Xray Photoemission spectroscoy
(HAXPES) was used to analyze the composition and distribution of cobalt and
neodymium at the top layers region of NdCo$_{4.6}$ films of thickness ranging
from 5 nm to 65 nm using 7 keV, 10 keV and 13 keV incident photon energies,
with inelastic electron mean free paths ranging from 7.2 nm to 12.3 nm in
cobalt. The atomic cobalt concentration of the alloy deduced from HAXPES
measurements at the Nd 3d and Co 2p excitations results to be bellow the
nominal value, changing with thickness and incident photon energy. This proves
a segregation of the rare earth at the surface of the NdCo$_{4.6}$ thin film
which increases with thickness. The analysis of the background of the Co 2p and
Nd 3d peaks was consistent with this conclusion. This demonstrates that
neodymium incorporation in the cobalt lattice have a cost in energy which can
be associated to strain due to the difference in volume between the two
elements. The lowering of this strain energy will favor atomic anisotropic
environments for neodymium that explains the perpendicular anisotropy and its
thickness dependence of these thin film compounds.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Spin-momentum locking in altermagnets has been deeply explored in the
non-relativistic limit. Including spin-orbit coupling, altermagnets exhibit
antisymmetric exchange interactions, leading to spin cantings. Therefore, the
spin-momentum locking differs among the three spin components Sx, Sy, and Sz,
forming the relativistic spin-momentum locking. We consider orthorhombic YVO3
and hexagonal MnTe. For YVO3, the relativistic locking comprises s-, dxy -, and
dxz-wave. In MnTe, the dominant component Sy of MnTe inherits the polarized
charge distribution and the non-relativistic spin-momentum locking bulk g-wave,
but the breaking of the C6z rotational symmetry by the Neel vector lowers the
symmetry from g-wave to d-wave. The relativistic spin-momentum locking for MnTe
is composed of dxz-, dyz- and s-wave. Despite small magnitudes in real space,
the canted spin components contribute significant spectral weight in k-space,
impacting k-space properties such as the spin-Hall conductivity.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The intrinsic coupling among electrical conductivity ($\sigma$), Seebeck
coefficient ($S$), and lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\mathrm{L}}$)
imposes a fundamental limit on the dimensionless figure of merit $ZT$ in
thermoelectric (TE) materials. Increasing band degeneracy can effectively
balance $\sigma$ and $S$, enabling a high power factor (PF, $S^{2}\sigma$).
However, compounds with intrinsically large band degeneracy are scarce. Here,
we present an unconventional strategy to realize elevated band degeneracy in
zigzag-chain Na$_2$Au$X$ ($X$ = P, As, Sb, Bi) compounds by harnessing strong
intra- and interchain orbital coupling. Pronounced hybridization between
Au-$d_{z^{2}}$ and $X$-$p_{z}$ orbitals along the Au--$X$ zigzag chains,
together with unexpectedly strong interchain $X$-$p_{x}/p_{y}$ coupling,
produces a highly dispersive, multivalley valence band structure that supports
an exceptional PF. Concurrently, the intrinsically weak interchain interactions
arising from the quasi-one-dimensional framework, together with the weakened
Au--$X$ and Au--Au bonds within the chains due to filling of $p$-$d^{*}$
antibonding states, result in an ultralow $\kappa_{\mathrm{L}}$.
First-principles calculations combined with Boltzmann transport theory predict
that $p$-type Na$_2$AuBi achieves a PF of
$63.9\,\mu\mathrm{W}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-1}\,\mathrm{K}^{-2}$, an ultralow
$\kappa_{\mathrm{L}}$ of $0.49\,\mathrm{W}\,\mathrm{m}^{-1}\,\mathrm{K}^{-1}$,
and a maximum $ZT$ of $4.7$ along the zigzag-chain direction at
$800\,\mathrm{K}$. This work establishes a new design paradigm for
high-efficiency TE materials by exploiting substantial orbital overlap in
structurally weakly bonded, quasi-one-dimensional systems, opening promising
avenues for the discovery and engineering of next-generation high-performance
TE materials.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The excited electronic states involved in the optical cycle preparation of a
pure spin state of the negatively charged NV-defect in diamond are calculated
using the HSE06 hybrid density functional and variational optimization of the
orbitals. This includes the energy of the excited triplet as well as the two
lowest singlet states with respect to the ground triplet state. In addition to
the vertical excitation, the effect of structural relaxation is also estimated
using analytical atomic forces. The lowering of the energy in the triplet
excited state and the resulting zero-phonon line triplet excitation energy are
both within 0.1 eV of the experimental estimates. An analogous relaxation in
the lower energy singlet state using spin purified atomic forces is estimated
to be 0.06 eV. These results, obtained with a hybrid density functional,
improve on previously published results using local and semi-local functionals,
which are known to underestimate the band gap. The good agreement with
experimental estimates demonstrates how time-independent variational
calculations of excited states using density functionals can give accurate
results and, thereby, provide a powerful screening tool for identifying other
defect systems as candidates for quantum technologies.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Double cation chalcohalide have recently been emerged as the interesting
candidates for sustainable energy conversion applications, owing to their
intrinsic chemical tunability, suitable band gap, and low thermal conductivity.
With this motivation, the current study is designed to explore the structural,
electron and phonon transport mechanism, and thermoelectric properties of
$CuBiSeX_{2} (X = Cl, Br)$ through density functional theory-based
computations. The experimental feasibility of the compounds is ensured, and
they are predicted to be thermally, dynamically, and mechanically stable. The
distinct structural attributes coupled with suitable electronic band structure
promotes the electron transport properties. Comprehensively, the delocalized Cu
atom enhancing the phonon scattering process and the off-centred displacement
of cations leading to bonding anharmonicity results ultra-low lattice thermal
conductivity $(\kappa_L)$. Among these systems, $CuBiSeCl_2$ exhibits low
$\kappa_L$ (0.24 $W m^{-1} K^{-1}$ at 300 K) and superior thermoelectric
performance (zT = 1.18 at 600 K), whereas $CuBiSeBr_2$ ($\kappa_L$ = 0.65 $W
m^{-1} K^{-1}$ at 300 K, zT = 0.68 at 600 K) demands further optimization.
Overall, the study sheds light into the interplay between the Cu diffusion and
bonding anisotropy in phonon propagation and establishes the potential of
double-cation chalcohalides for mid-temperature thermoelectric applications.

Abstract: The development of extreme ultraviolet sources is critical for advancing
angleresolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), a powerful technique for
probing the electronic structure of materials. Here, we report the construction
of a tabletop 10.8-eV femtosecond laser through cascaded third-harmonic
generation, which operates at a repetition rate of 1 MHz and delivers a photon
flux of approximately 1012 photons/s. The system achieves a high energy
resolution of approximately 11.8 meV and tunable polarization. This flexibility
enables detailed studies of orbitaland (pseudo)spin characteristics in quantum
materials. We demonstrate the capabilities of this laser-ARPES system by
investigating several prototypical materials, showcasing its potential for
elucidating complex phenomena in quantum materials.

Abstract: The control of localized magnetic domains at the nanoscale holds great
promise for next-generation spintronic applications. Colloidal transition metal
dichalcogenides nanostructures are experimentally accessible and chemically
tunable platforms for spintronics, deserving dedicated research to assess their
potential. Here, we investigate from first principles free-standing triangular
MoS2 nanoflakes with sulfur-terminated, hydrogen-passivated edges, to probe
intrinsic spin behavior at varying side lengths. We find a critical edge length
of approximately 1.5 nm separating nonmagnetic nanoflakes from larger ones with
a magnetic ground state emerging from several, energetically competing spin
configurations. In these systems, the magnetic activity is not uniformly
distributed along the edges but localized on specific "magnetic islands" around
molybdenum edge atoms. The localization of magnetic moments is robust even in
non-equilateral nanoflake geometries, highlighting their intrinsic stability
regardless of the (high) symmetry of the hosting structure. These findings
establish that the S-terminated, H-passivated triangular MoS2 nanoflakes are a
stable and experimentally accessible platform via colloidal synthesis for
low-dimensional, next-generation spintronic devices.

Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate the use of CQDs synthesized from lignin -
currently one of the most abundant and underutilized by-products of paper and
pulp production - for advanced pH monitoring applications. The presented
approach integrates green chemistry principles with an operator-friendly,
low-cost, and practical solution for spatial and temporal pH measurement. CQDs
functionalized with m-aminophenylboronic acid enable highly sensitive and
reversible pH readouts through two complementary mechanisms: ratiometric
monitoring of emission band intensities, and direct visual observation of
colorimetric changes reflected in the CIE1931 chromaticity coordinates. The
system achieves maximal sensitivities of 137 percent per pH unit and 49.5
percent per pH unit, respectively, while simultaneously maintaining high
measurement resolution and full reproducibility of the readouts, placing it
among the most effective CQD-based pH sensors reported to date. Here, we
demonstrate the capability of 2D luminescent imaging of pH distributions,
allowing for both spatially resolved and time-resolved monitoring. Employing
just an excitation source, a digital camera or smartphone, and RGB channel
analysis, the setup eliminates the necessity for specialized filters or
sophisticated instrumentation. The combination of multimodal readout strategies
with the capacity for large-area visualization establishes lignin-derived CQDs
as a sustainable and practical platform for pH sensing. By simultaneously
addressing the challenges of waste valorization and the demand for innovative
sensing technologies, this solution fulfills the requirements of both
environmentally responsible material design and next-generation pH sensor
development.

Abstract: The determination of the phase diagram of water ice under extreme conditions
remains a fundamental challenge in high-pressure physics. While theoretical
predictions have long suggested the existence of compact phases, such as
face-centered cubic (fcc) and hexagonal close-packed (hcp) structures, yet only
the fcc phase has been experimentally confirmed. Here, we report the first
direct observation of a hcp ice phase using synchrotron x-ray diffraction in
laser-heated diamond anvil cells. Between 80 and 200 GPa, we observe the
coexistence of fcc and hcp ice, arising from stacking disorder in the fcc
oxygen layers, similar to phenomena seen in compressed noble gases. Above 200
GPa, the hcp phase becomes dominant and is recovered at 300 K, indicating its
increased thermodynamic stability at ultrahigh pressures. These findings not
only expand our understanding of water's complex behavior under extreme
conditions but also may play a crucial role in the interiors of giant icy
planets.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Nanocrystalline materials are promising candidates for future fusion reactor
applications, due to their high density of grain boundaries which may serve as
sinks for irradiation induced defects. We use molecular dynamics to simulate
collision cascades in nanocrystalline iron and compare these to collision
cascades in initially defect free single crystals. We create nanocrystalline
samples via Voronoi tessellation of initially randomly placed grain seeds and
via severe plastic shearing. An irradiation induced annealing is observed
whereby after ~ 2 displacements per atom (dpa), irradiation drives all
simulation cells to a single crystalline state. Irradiation-induced defects
that distort the lattice generate elastic strain, so we use excess potential
energy as a measure of defect content. At low doses, the Voronoi samples
feature a few large, low energy grains, whereas the sheared samples show many
small, high energy grains due to the high defect and grain boundary content
caused by severe deformation. As dose increases beyond 1 dpa however, all
nanocrystalline samples converge to a similar behaviour. Excess potential
energy mirrors this trend, plateauing above ~ 4 dpa. We hypothesise that the
initially pristine cells will also reach a similar plateau after 5 dpa, which
is seemingly confirmed by running a single instance of each cell type to 10
dpa. A model is developed to explain the energy evolution.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to investigate the
influence of mechanical strain on irradiation-induced defect and dislocation
evolution in nickel single crystals subjected to cumulative overlapping 5 keV
collision cascades at 300 K. The simulations reveal that tensile strain
modifies the dynamics of defect generation and recovery, promoting
stress-assisted defect mobility and enhancing defect survival compared to the
unstrained case. The heat spike duration and intensity decrease systematically
with increasing strain, indicating faster energy dissipation and altered defect
recombination behavior under applied stress. Analysis of the dislocation
structure shows that Shockley-type partial dislocations dominate the
microstructural response, while Hirth and other dislocation types remain
comparatively minor. Both the total and Shockley dislocation densities reach a
saturation value of $~10^{16}m^{-2}$ , marking the establishment of a
steady-state microstructure governed by the balance between dislocation
accumulation and recovery. The evolution of the total dislocation density with
strain is successfully described by the Kocks-Mecking model, demonstrating its
applicability to strain-dependent irradiation effects in metallic systems

Abstract: Tuning magnetic anisotropy through chemical doping is a powerful strategy for
designing functional materials with enhanced magnetic properties. Here, we
report an enhanced Er^3+ magnetic moment resulting from nonmagnetic Lu^3+
substitution in the honeycomb-lattice antiferromagnet ErOCl. Unlike the
Curie-Weiss type divergence typically observed in diluted magnetic systems, our
findings reveal a distinct enhancement of magnetization per Er^3+ ion under
high magnetic fields, suggesting an unconventional mechanism. Structural
analysis reveals that Lu^3+ doping leads to a pronounced contraction of the c
axis, which is attributed to chemical pressure effects, while preserving the
layered SmSI-type crystal structure with space group R-3m. High-resolution
Raman spectroscopy reveals a systematic blueshift of the first and seventh
crystalline electric field (CEF) excitations, indicating an increase in the
axial CEF parameter B_2^0. This modification enhances the magnetic anisotropy
along the c axis, leading to a significant increase in magnetization at low
temperatures and under high magnetic fields, contrary to conventional
expectations for magnetic dilution. Our work not only clarifies the intimate
connection between magnetism and CEF in rare-earth compounds, but more
importantly, it reveals a physical pathway to effectively tune magnetic
anisotropy via anisotropic lattice distortion induced by chemical pressure.

Abstract: Quantitative electron magnetic circular dichroism (EMCD) in transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) enables the measurement of magnetic moments with
elemental and atomic site sensitivity, but its practical application is
fundamentally limited by noise. This study presents a comprehensive methodology
for noise estimation and suppression in EMCD measurements, demonstrated on
Ti-doped barium hexaferrite lamellae. By employing a classical three-beam
geometry and long-term acquisition of electron energy-loss spectra, we
systematically analyze the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) across individual energy
channels using bootstrap statistics. A robust energy alignment procedure based
on the neighboring Ba-M4,5 edges with an adequate energy upsampling is
introduced to minimize systematic errors from energy misalignment. The impact
of detector noise, particularly from CMOS-based EELS cameras, is evaluated
through variance-to-mean analysis and described by the noise amplification
coefficients, revealing that detector-amplified shot noise is the dominant
noise source. We recommend a stricter SNR threshold for reliable EMCD detection
and quantification, ensuring that critical spectral features such as the
Fe-L2,3 peaks meet the requirements for quantitative analysis. The approach
also provides a framework for determining the minimum electron dose necessary
for valid measurements and can be generalized to scintillator-based or direct
electron detectors. This work advances the reliability of EMCD as a
quantitative tool for magnetic characterization at the nanoscale with unknown
magnetic structures. The proposed procedures lay the groundwork for improved
error handling and SNR optimization in future EMCD studies.

Abstract: Engineering van Hove singularities (vHss) near the Fermi level, if feasible,
offers a powerful route to control exotic quantum phases in electronic and
magnetic behaviors. However, conventional approaches, which rely primarily on
chemical and electrical doping, focus mainly on local electrical or optical
measurements, limiting their applicability to coupled functionalities. In this
study, a vHs-induced insulator-metal transition coupled with a ferromagnetic
phase transition was empirically achieved in atomically designed quasi-2D
SrRuO3 (SRO) superlattices via epitaxial strain engineering, which has not been
observed in conventional 3D SRO systems. Theoretical calculations revealed that
epitaxial strain effectively modulates the strength and energy positions of vHs
of specific Ru orbitals, driving correlated phase transitions in the electronic
and magnetic ground states. X-ray absorption spectroscopy confirmed the
anisotropic electronic structure of quasi-2D SRO modulated by epitaxial strain.
Magneto-optic Kerr effect and electrical transport measurements demonstrated
modulated magnetic and electronic phases. Furthermore, magneto-electrical
measurements detected significant anomalous Hall effect signals and
ferromagnetic magnetoresistance, indicating the presence of magnetically
coupled charge carriers in the 2D metallic regime. This study establishes
strain engineering as a promising platform for tuning vHss and resultant
itinerant ferromagnetism of low-dimensional correlated quantum systems.

Abstract: Neutron irradiation produces, within a few picoseconds, displacement cascades
that are sequences of atomic collisions generating point and extended defects
which subsequently affects the long-term evolution of materials. The diversity
of these defects, characterized morphologically and statistically, defines what
is called the "primary damage". In this work, we present a fully unsupervised
machine learning (ML) workflow that detects and classifies these defects
directly from molecular dynamics data. Local environments are encoded by the
Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP) vector, anomalous atoms are isolated
with autoencoder neural networks (AE), embedded with Uniform Man- ifold
Approximation and Projection (UMAP) and clustered using Hierarchical
Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN). Applied
to 80 keV displacement cascades in Ni, Fe70Ni10Cr20, and Zr, the AE
successfully identify the small fraction of outlier atoms that participate in
defect formation. HDBSCAN then partitions the UMAP latent space of AE-flagged
SOAP de- scriptors into well defined groups representing vacancy- and
interstitial-dominated regions and, within each, separates small from large
aggregates, assigning 99.7 % of outliers to compact physical motifs. A signed
cluster-identification score confirms this separation, and cluster size scales
with net defect counts (R2 > 0.89). Statistical cross analyses between the ML
outlier map and several conventional detectors (centrosymmetry, dislocation
extraction, etc.) reveal strong overlap and complementary coverage, all
achieved without template or threshold tuning. This ML workflow thus provides
an efficient tool for the quantitative mapping of structural anomalies in
materials, particularly those arising from irradiation damage in displacement

Abstract: Kagome metals are an intriguing class of quantum materials as the presence of
both flat bands and Dirac points provides access to functional properties
present in strongly correlated and topological materials. To fully harness
these electronic features, the ability to tune the Fermi level relative to the
band positions is needed. Here we explore the structural, electronic and
magnetic impacts of substitutional alloying within ferromagnetic kagome metal
Fe3Sn2 in thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. Transition metals Mn and
Co are chosen as substitutes for Fe to reduce or increase the d-band electron
count, thereby moving the Fermi level accordingly. We find that Co is not
incorporated into the Fe3Sn2 structure but instead results in a two-phase Fe-Co
and (Fe,Co)Sn composite. In contrast, Fe3-xMnxSn2 films are realized with x up
to 1.0, retaining crystalline quality comparable to the parent phase. The
incorporation of Mn repositions the flat bands relative to the Fermi level in a
manner consistent with hole-doping, as revealed by hard x-ray photoemission and
density functional theory. The Fe3-xMnxSn2 films retain room temperature
ferromagnetism, with x-ray magnetic circular dichroism measurements confirming
that the Fe and Mn moments are ferromagnetically aligned. The ability to
hole-dope this magnetic kagome metal provides a platform for tuning properties
such as anomalous Hall and Nernst responses.

Abstract: The magnetic properties of van der Waals materials are profoundly influenced
by structural defects. The layered antiferromagnet MnPS3 offers a unique
opportunity to explore defect-related magnetism, as Mn2+ vacancies can be
generated by the intercalation of specific guest molecules. However, the
effectiveness of this process in atomically thin flakes and the extent of the
magnetic tunability remain unclear. Here, we show that the magnetic properties
of MnPS3 can be tailored through the intercalation of different guest
molecules. Notably, the insertion of four alkylammonium ions introduces
different populations of Mn2+ vacancies, leading to a transition from the
pristine antiferromagnetic state to more complex magnetic textures, including a
ferrimagnetic state displaying a magnetic saturation of 1 uB/atom. Moreover, we
show that the intercalation of few-nm-thick flakes also leads to the emergence
of a ferrimagnetic response. This in-flake intercalation, which can be
monitored in real time using optical microscopy, can be interrupted before
completion, generating lateral heterostructures between pristine and
intercalated areas. This approach opens the way to the use of partial
intercalation to define regions with distinct magnetic properties within a
single flake.

Abstract: This study examines the tribological behavior of diamond-like carbon (DLC)
coatings doped with silicon (Si), cobalt (Co), or silver (Ag) in the presence
of an amine-functionalized block copolymer lubricant. Under boundary
lubrication, Si-doped DLC (Si-DLC) exhibited the lowest coefficient of friction
($\approx$0.045) and nearly 45% lower wear than undoped DLC. Co-DLC showed
moderate improvement, while Ag-DLC provided no significant benefit.
Cross-sectional FIB-TEM revealed thin tribofilms, 12-17 nm in thickness, on Si-
and Co-doped surfaces. As reported for Si-DLC, these films incorporate
copolymer-derived fragments, suggesting a similar composition for Co-DLC. These
results indicate that dopant-polymer interactions are key to the development of
self-organized boundary layers. To gain atomic-level insight, first-principles
calculations were carried out on the adsorption of the dimethylaminoethyl
methacrylate (DMAEMA) unit, the copolymer's functional group. The calculated
adsorption energies were $-$2.27 to $-$0.57 eV for Si-DLC, $-$1.73 to $-$1.49
eV for Co(0001), and $-$1.21 to $-$1.08 eV for Ag(111). The order of stability
(Si $>$ Co $>$ Ag) was consistent with the experimental tribological ranking.
Chemical bonding dominated for Si-DLC, while Ag showed mainly weak
physisorption. Simulated pull-off forces further reflected this hierarchy, with
N-Si bonds requiring about twice the force of N-Co and nearly five times that
of N-Ag. The correspondence between adsorption strength and tribological
response highlights the decisive role of dopant species in tribofilm formation.
These findings provide guidance for designing durable low-friction surfaces in
applications such as electric drivetrains and precision mechanical systems.

Abstract: Recent theoretical advances have highlighted the role of Bloch state
intrinsic properties in enabling unconventional electro-optic (EO) phenomena in
bulk metals, offering novel strategies for dynamic optical control in quantum
materials. Here, we identify an alternative EO mechanism in bulk metallic
systems that arises from the interplay between Berry curvature and the orbital
magnetic moment of Bloch electrons. Focusing on twisted double-bilayer graphene
(TDBG), we show that the enhanced intrinsic properties of moir\'e Bloch bands
give rise to a sizable linear magnetoelectric EO response, a first-order,
electric-field-induced non-Hermitian correction to the gyrotropic magnetic
susceptibility. This mechanism dominates in $C_{3z}$-symmetric TDBG, where EO
contributions originating from the Berry curvature dipole (BCD) are
symmetry-forbidden. Our calculations reveal giant, gate-tunable linear and
circular dichroism in the terahertz regime, establishing a robust and tunable
platform for ultrafast EO modulation in two-dimensional materials beyond the
BCD paradigm.

Abstract: Recent work on Majorana-bound states in semiconductor-superconductor hybrid
structures has elucidated the key role of unintentional (and unknown) disorder
(producing low-energy Andreev-bound states) in the system, which is detrimental
to the emergence of Majorana-carrying topological superconductivity
artificially engineered through the combination of superconductivity, Zeeman
spin splitting, and Rashba spin-orbit coupling. In particular, the disorder
must be smaller than the superconducting gap for the appearance of Majorana
modes, but the disorder-induced appearance of subgap Andreev-bound states
suppresses the Majorana modes. We theoretically investigate, as a function of
disorder, the normal state ballistic transport properties of nanowires with and
without superconductors in order to provide guidance on how to experimentally
estimate the level of disorder. Experimentally, the superconductivity is
suppressed simply by rotating the magnetic field appropriately, so both physics
can be studied in the same set-up. In particular, the presence of spin-orbit
coupling and Zeeman splitting produces a helical gap in the 1D electronic band
structure, which should have clear signatures in ballistic transport unless
these signatures are suppressed by disorder and/or Fabry-P\'erot resonances
associated with the finite wire sizes. Our work provides a benchmarking of when
and what signatures of the putative helical gap (which is essential for the
emergence of Majorana modes by leading to a single Fermi surface) could
manifest in realistic nanowires.

Abstract: Recent experimental and theoretical studies have revealed the emergence of a
linear layer Hall effect (LHE) induced by hidden Berry curvature in
\textrm{MnBi}$_{2}$\textrm{Te}$_{4}$ thin films. This phenomenon underscores
the layer degree of freedom as a novel mechanism for generating Hall transport
in layered materials, providing a new pathway to probe and manipulate the
internal structure of fully compensated topological antiferromagnets (AFMs). In
this work, we predict a nonlinear LHE in $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric layered AFMs,
which manifests as a detectable nonlinear Hall conductivity even with respect
to the AFM order and odd with respect to the vertical electric field, in
contrast to the linear LHE. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the nonlinear Hall
currents induced by the hidden BCD and quantum metric dipole (QMD) obey
distinct symmetries and flow in different directions. Our proposed nonlinear
LHE establishes an experimentally advantageous framework for exclusively
probing the hidden BCD quantum geometry.

Abstract: The ability to modulate the photoluminescence (PL) of nanomaterials via
spin-related effects is vital for many emerging quantum technologies, with
nanoscale quantum sensing and imaging being particular areas of focus.
Carbon-based quantum dots (CQDs) are among the most common forms of luminescent
nanomaterials, appealing due to their ease of synthesis, tunability through
organic chemistry, high brightness, and natural biocompatibility. However, the
observation of room temperature, spin-dependent PL has remained elusive. Here
we report on the observation of PL modulation of CQDs by magnetic fields ($\sim
10$ mT) under ambient conditions. We synthesize a series of CQDs using 19
different amino acids, which have a range of PL emission spectra and exhibit a
clear magneto-PL effect (up to $\sim 1$% change). Furthermore, an electron spin
resonance is detected in the PL with a g-factor of g $\approx$ 2, suggesting a
process similar to the radical pair mechanism is responsible. Finally, we show
that the magneto-PL contrast decreases in the presence of paramagnetic species,
which we attribute to an increase in magnetic noise-induced spin relaxation in
the CQDs. Our work brings new functionalities to these commonly used and
biocompatible luminescent nanoparticles, opening new opportunities for in situ
quantum sensing and imaging of biological samples.

Abstract: In third-order nonlinear transport, a voltage can be measured in response to
the cube of a driving current as a result of the quantum geometric effects,
which has attracted tremendous attention. However, in realistic materials where
disorder scattering also contributes to nonlinear transport, identifying the
geometric mechanisms remains a challenge. We find a total of 20 mechanisms of
third-order nonlinear transport by developing a comprehensive theory that
treats the geometric effects and disorder scattering on an equal footing. More
importantly, we find that 12 of these mechanisms can be unambiguously
identified, by deriving a scaling law that expresses the third-order nonlinear
Hall conductivity as a polynomial in the linear longitudinal conductivity. We
apply this theory to identify the geometric mechanisms of third-order nonlinear
transport in materials both with and without time-reversal symmetry, such as 2D
materials, topological materials, and altermagnets. This theory further
promotes nonlinear transport as a probe of geometric effects and phase
transitions in quantum materials.

Abstract: The recent discovery that electrons in nano-scale conductors can act like a
highly viscous liquid has triggered a surge of research activities
investigating consequences of this surprising fact. Here we demonstrate that
the electronic viscosity has an enormous influence on the operation of a
prototypical AC-current-driven nano-motor. The design of this prototype
consists of a diatomic molecule immersed in an otherwise homogeneous electron
liquid which carries an AC current. The motion of the diatomic is determined by
a subtle balance between the current-induced forces and electronic friction. By
ab-initio time-dependent density-functional simulations we demonstrate that the
diatomic performs a continuous rotation provided the amplitude and frequency of
the imposed AC current lie within certain islands of stability. Outside these
islands the nuclear motion is either chaotic or comes to a stand-still. The
proposed design of the nano-motor is the conceptually simplest realization of
the idea of an molecular waterwheel sandwiched between conducting leads

Abstract: Motivated by the emerging control of Berry-curvature textures in
altermagnets, we explore a two-terminal configuration where a
topological-insulator film is interfaced with two altermagnetic electrodes
whose crystalline phases can be rotated independently. The proximity coupling
imprints each momentum-dependent of the altermagnet spin texture onto the Dirac
surface states, giving rise to an angular mass whose sign follows the lattice
orientation. Adjusting the phase of one electrode redefines this mass pattern,
thereby tuning the number and spatial distribution of chiral edge channels.
This results in discrete conductance steps and a reversible inversion of the
thermoelectric coefficient-achieved without external magnetic fields or net
magnetization. A compact Dirac model captures both the quantized switching and
its resilience to moderate disorder. Overall, this symmetry-driven mechanism
provides a practical and low-dissipation route to programmable topological
transport via lattice rotation.

Abstract: Undoped Si-SiGe two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) provide an ideal platform
for hosting quantum-dot spin-qubits owing enhanced spin dephasing times and
compatibility with standard CMOS technology. The strained Si quantum well
reduces the valley degeneracy into two closely spaced ones. The existence of a
near-degenerate valley state act as a leakage channel and compromises gate
fidelity. A robust and uniform valley splitting across the entire chip is
crucial for achieving scalability in the architecture and reliability in
operation. Imperfections such as broadened interfaces, alloy disorders and
atomic steps significantly compromise the valley splitting. The associated
scattering mechanisms play detrimental roles in the performance of the qubits.
In this manuscript, exploiting low-temperature magnetotransport measurements,
we investigate the scattering mechanisms and valley splitting in a
high-mobility undoped Si-SiGe 2DEG. At lower carrier densities, transport is
limited by remote impurity scattering, whereas at higher densities, background
impurity scattering near the quantum well dominates. Both the transport and
quantum lifetimes of the charge carriers increase with carrier concentration,
due to the enhancement in the impurity screening. Magnetic-field-induced
confinement effect also is found to improve the valley splitting.
Current-biasing measurements reveals the role of carrier heating in the
visibility of valley splitting and reveal a temperature limited valley
splitting of approximately 100 micro-eV. These results provide critical insight
into scattering-dominated regimes and valley splitting in undoped Si-SiGe,
advancing its potential for silicon-based quantum devices.

Abstract: Advances in quantum technologies are often limited by slow device
characterization, complex tuning require- ments, and scalability challenges.
Spin qubits in electrostatically defined quantum dots provide a promising
platform but are not exempt from these limitations. Simulations enhance our
understanding of such devices, and in many cases, rapid feedback between
measurements and simulations can guide the development of op- timal design and
control strategies. Here, we introduce a modular, graph-based simulator that
acts as a digital surrogate for a semiconductor quantum dot device, where
computationally expensive processes are accelerated using deep learning. We
demonstrate its potential by estimating crosstalk effects between gate
electrodes and applying these estimates to construct virtual gates in a quantum
dot device. We validate our approach through comparison with experiments on a
double quantum dot defined in a Ge/SiGe heterostructure. We envision that this
simulation framework will advance semiconductor-based quantum technologies by
enabling more efficient design, characterization, and control of complex
devices.

Abstract: The electron phonon coupling of a defect characterized by its Huang Rhys (HR)
factor is a crucial metric determining its excited-state dynamics, relevant to
defect applications as qubits and quantum emitters. However, HR factors remain
challenging to calculate from first principles, complicated by convergence
issues in excited-state relaxation and time consuming phonon calculations. Even
when calculated, HR factors lack a rational design principle. Here we show that
an orbital-based descriptor can be used to rationalize and efficiently estimate
HR factors. Combining this descriptor with a ground state deformation technique
allows circumventing both excited state relaxation and full phonon
calculations. Specifically, our descriptor for HR factors is constructed using
bonding character differences obtained from ground state density functional
theory, measured using crystal orbital Hamilton populations. We demonstrate
this descriptor for prototypical hBN defects and the diamond NV center. This
orbital-based descriptor can be potentially used in high throughput
computational screening to identify ideal candidates of spin qubits and SPEs.

Abstract: We report a pronounced Hebel-Slichter coherence peak in the zero field
nuclear quadrupolar resonance (NQR) spin-lattice relaxation rate of the
topological crystalline superconductor LaNiGa$_2$ in the superconducting state.
Previously, a two-band internally antisymmetric non-unitary triplet pairing
(INT) state was proposed for this system, with equal spin-pairing and two
distinct gaps associated with different spins. A detailed examination of the
temperature dependence of the NQR data shows that the data best fit an INT
model if the two gaps are equal and the model is unitary. Even a tiny
non-unitarity with two unequal gaps causes the coherence peak to diminish
rapidly and deviate from the data. On the other hand, the data are well-fit by
a two-band singlet BCS-like pairing with two distinct gaps consistent with
previous measurements. This raises doubts on the identification of non-unitary
triplet-pairing with time-reversal symmetry breaking in this material.

Abstract: We predict the realization of ultrastrong coupling between magnons of
antiferromagnets and photons in superconductor/antiferromagnet/superconductor
heterostructures at terahertz frequencies, from both quantum and classical
perspectives. The hybridization of the two magnon modes with photons strongly
depends on the applied magnetic field: at zero magnetic field, only a single
antiferromagnetic mode with a lower frequency couples to the photon, forming a
magnon-polariton, while using a magnetic field activates coupling for both
antiferromagnetic modes. The coupling between magnon and photon is ultrastrong
with the coupling constant $\sim$ 100 GHz exceeding 10% of the
antiferromagnetic resonant frequency. The superconductor modulates the spin of
the resulting magnon-polaritons and the group velocity, achieving values
amounting to several tenths of the speed of light, which promises strong
tunability of magnon transport in antiferromagnets by superconductors.

Abstract: Strong evidence of unconventional superconductivity has been very recently
reported experimentally in twisted transition metal dichalcogenide bilayer and
gathered a significant amount of interest. Here we consider the Hubbard model
on a triangular lattice describing the hole-doped moir\'e superlattice emerging
in WSe$_{2}$/WSe$_{2}$ twisted homobilayer in the moderately correlated regime.
By applying the Density Matrix Renormalization Group, we diagonalize the
spin-valley-polarized Hamiltonian and show signatures of coexisting singlet and
triplet pairings in the range of hole dopings and displacement fields reported
in the experiments. In this view, we show that the superconductivity in the
WSe$_{2}$/WSe$_{2}$ twisted homobilayer is likely to be induced by electronic
correlations and has a mixed-symmetry character. These predictions can shed
light on the nature of the superconducting state observed in the twisted
homobilayer of WSe$_{2}$/WSe$_{2}$. We also identify the emerging
superconducting orders, which are $d_{xy}(d_{x^2-y^2} \pm id_{xy} )$ and
$p_y(p_{x}\mp ip_{y})$ for the singlet and triplet channels in the cylinder of

Abstract: Recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density

heavy-fermion superconductor CeRh$_2$As$_2$ exhibits van Hove singularities and
the Dirac point near the Fermi level $E_{\mathrm F}$, which are key signatures
of strong-correlation effects and quantum geometry. We have constructed a
two-dimensional 12-orbital \textit{Dirac-Anderson} model as an effective model
for CeRh$_2$As$_2$. The band structure and Fermi-surface topology of the
Dirac-Anderson model agree well with the ARPES data and the DFT+$U$
calculations. We show that the quantum geometry strongly favors
magnetic-monopole fluctuations because of the Dirac point at the $M$ point. By
solving the linearized \'{E}liashberg equation, we demonstrate that the
$B_{1u}$ and $B_{2g}$ representations, spin-triplet states originating from the
Dirac point, exhibit the leading superconducting instabilities. By comparing
the random-phase approximation and the fluctuation-exchange approximation, we
further demonstrate that strong-correlation effects mitigate the influence of
quantum geometry. The phase diagram of CeRh$_2$As$_2$ under pressure is
discussed in connection with the theoretical results.

simulations to study a sign-problem-free bilayer extended Hubbard model. In
this model, a charge stripe phase, characterized by a peak at momentum
$k_x=2\pi\delta$ is induced by highly anisotropic interlayer spin-exchange
coupling $J_z$, and strongly suppressed upon introducing the spin-flip term
$J_\bot$; in contrast, \(J_\perp\) favors the emergence of interlayer pairing
superconductivity. We further demonstrate that the anisotropy of the interlayer
spin-exchange directly governs the competition between these two phases, while
the on-site interaction \(U\) plays a complex role in tuning both the charge
stripe and superconductivity. Our work identifies the key factors driving
charge stripe formation, highlights the sensitivity of both the charge stripe
and superconducting phases to interaction parameters, and thereby provides
valuable insights into competing orders in strongly correlated systems.

Abstract: The intercalation of guest species into the gap of van der Waals materials
often leads to the emergence of intriguing phenomena, such as
superconductivity. While intercalation-induced superconductivity has been
reported in several bulk crystals, reaching a zero-resistance state in flakes
remains challenging. Here, we show a simple method for enhancing the
superconducting transition in tens-of-nm thick 2H-TaS2 crystals contacted by
gold electrodes through in-situ intercalation. Our approach enables measuring
the electrical characteristics of the same flake before and after
intercalation, permitting us to precisely identify the effect of the guest
species on the TaS2 transport properties. We find that the intercalation of
amylamine molecules into TaS2 flakes causes a suppression of the charge density
wave and an increase in the superconducting transition, with an onset
temperature above 3 K. Additionally, we show that a fully developed
zero-resistance state can be achieved in flakes by engineering the conditions
of the chemical intercalation. Our findings pave the way for the integration of
chemically tailored intercalation compounds in scalable quantum technologies.
