Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Phonon spectra in solids often display anomalies that defy the simple Debye
law, most prominently the van Hove singularity in crystals and the boson peak
in glasses. Although traditionally regarded as distinct, both features are
increasingly recognized as sharing a common physical origin. In a recent work,
G. Ding et al. (Nat. Phys. 2025) propose a resonant-damping model that unifies
these anomalies within a single framework. By coupling phonon damping to
vibrational softening, their theory explains why some materials exhibit van
Hove peaks, others boson peaks, and many show both. This advance extends
earlier ideas and theories of Baggioli and Zaccone on the competition between
phonon propagation and damping, while also connecting to microscopic mechanisms
such as nonaffine motions in glasses. The resonant-damping paradigm thus offers
a promising step toward a unified understanding of vibrational anomalies across
ordered and disordered solids.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In alloy design, the search for candidate materials is often framed as an
optimization problem, with the goal of identifying Pareto-optimal solutions
across multiple objectives. However, Pareto-optimal solutions do not
necessarily satisfy all minimum performance thresholds required for practical
deployment. An alternative approach is to treat alloy design as a constraint
satisfaction problem, in which the goal is to identify any solution that meets
all bare minimum requirements across multiple quantities of interest. These
approaches have yet to be benchmarked against each other in the context of
realistic alloy design problems. In this work, we demonstrate that, in
realistic alloy design campaigns involving multiple objectives and constraints,
the constraint satisfaction framework yields a higher likelihood of finding
viable alloys than optimization-based approaches. Furthermore,
constraint-satisfaction approaches find the first viable alloy solutions
earlier than optimization. Our results suggest that focusing on feasibility
rather than optimality can lead to more actionable outcomes in materials
discovery, particularly in highly constrained applications.

Abstract: Magnetic topology and its associated emergent phenomena are central to
realizing intriguing quantum states and spintronics functionalities. Designing
spin textures to achieve strong and distinct electrical responses remains a
significant challenge. Layered transition metal dichalcogenides offer a
versatile platform for tailoring structural and magnetic properties, enabling
access to a wide spectrum of topological magnetic states. Here, we report a
domain-wall-driven, large, and tunable topological Hall effect (THE) in a
non-centrosymmetric intercalated transition metal dichalcogenides series
Fe$_x$TaS$_2$. By systematically varying the Fe intercalation level, we exert
precise control over the magnetic ground states, allowing manipulation of the
topological Hall effect. Real-space magnetic force microscopy (MFM) provides
direct evidence of periodic magnetic stripe domain formation, confirming the
microscopic origin of the observed topological transport phenomena. Our
findings establish a promising way for tuning the topology of domains to
generate substantial electromagnetic responses in layered magnetic materials.

Abstract: Recently, spin splitting of non-relativistic origin in compensated
antiferromagnets has drawn growing attention in condensed matter research.
Although many materials, now known to exhibit such spin splitting, have been
studied for decades, their manifestation along non-high-symmetry momentum
directions initially hindered their recognition. In recent years, significant
progress has been made in uncovering the symmetry principles that allow
non-relativistic spin splitting in the absence of net magnetization, revealing
the unconventional physics arising from their coexistence. In this review, we
provide a concise overview of non-relativistic spin splitting in compensated
antiferromagnets with various spin configurations, including collinear,
coplanar, and non-coplanar spin arrangements. We summarize practical
identification guidelines, highlight characteristic features in electronic band
structures, and discuss the emerging functionalities, with an emphasis on
promising directions for future exploration.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Rectification properties of semiconductor p-n junction diodes are the basic
and important characteristics for electronic device evaluation, especially for
novel semiconductor materials. Today's semiconductor devices' fabrication and
integration processes require multibillion-dollar investments and are desired
to be reduced or simplified. Therefore, low-cost and non-toxic base metal
materials with simple fabrication methods are desired for the future
semiconductor industry. Recently, copper-based sulfides have been studied for
semiconductor devices such as thermoelectric, photovoltaic, or water-splitting
applications. Here, a highly rectifying p-n diode of a cubic (disordered) phase
Cu4Fe5S8 polycrystal with a zincblende-like structure fabricated by a
simple/low-cost wet process is shown. It is found that the Cu4Fe5S8 diode shows
the highest rectification ratio in the order of 106 with a large forward
current density of 15 Acm-2 (@1.5 V forward bias) at room temperature among the
other compounds of copper iron sulfide devices. This remarkable and stable
diode characteristic obtained by the p-type layer anodically grown on the
sintered n-type cubic-Cu4Fe5S8 can bring the industry closer to low-cost
semiconductor manufacturing. These results open a platform of novel
semiconductor materials such as cubic-Cu4Fe5S8 with further superior crystal
growth and conductive characteristics.

Abstract: An isolated calcium (Ca) atom has empty d-orbitals under ambient conditions.
However, s-d band hybridization has been observed in both elemental Ca and
compounds by manipulating thermodynamic conditions. Here, we reveal that the Ca
3d-band can even capture electrons from halogen atoms under pressure,
exhibiting anionic behaviors in iodides. We predict a CsCl-type monovalent CaI
at above 50 GPa by employing first-principles structural searching and
successfully identified the phase at 84 GPa using in situ X-ray diffraction. We
further reveal that, due to the effect of orbital broadening, unusual charge
transfer from the 5p orbitals of I to the 3d orbitals of Ca in CaI, gradually
reverses the ionicity of Ca and becomes the anionic ICa at 485 GPa. Multivalent
Ca stabilizes a set of metallic iodides with eight- to ten-fold iodine
hyper-coordination. Our findings demonstrate that the valence states of Ca can
vary from negative to +2, suggesting much greater complexity of Ca chemistry
under ultrahigh pressures.

Abstract: The adsorption of PBr3 on the Si(100)-2$\times$1 surface was studied by
scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and density functional theory (DFT). The
PBr3 molecule completely dissociates on the Si(100) surface at room temperature
into P and Br atoms. In most cases, the dissociated molecule was observed in
STM on three neighboring Si dimers. DFT calculations confirm that the PBr3
molecule can completely dissociate at room temperature. After annealing the
sample to 400$^{\circ}$C, phosphorus is incorporated into silicon, as evidenced
by the Si atoms ejected to the surface. These findings are useful for the
insertion of individual phosphorus atoms into silicon by PBr3 adsorption
through a halogen mask.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Silicon dangling bonds (DBs) on an adsorbate-covered Si(100) surface can be
created in a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) with high precision required
for a number of applications. However, vacancies containing DBs can diffuse,
disrupting precisely created structures. In this work, we study the diffusion
of Br vacancies on a Si(100)-2$\times$1-Br surface in an STM under typical
imaging conditions. In agreement with previous work, Br vacancies diffuse at a
positive sample bias voltage. Here, we demonstrated that only vacancies
containing a positively charged DB hop across the two atoms of a single Si
dimer, while vacancies containing neutral and negatively charged DBs do not.
Calculations based on the density functional theory confirmed that positively
charged Br (and Cl) vacancies have a minimum activation barrier. We propose
that diffusion operates by both one-electron and two-electron mechanisms
depending on the applied voltage. Our results show that the DB charge has a
critical effect on the vacancy diffusion. This effect should be taken into
account when imaging surface structures with charged DBs, as well as when
studying the diffusion of other atoms and molecules on the Si(100) surface with
vacancies in an adsorbate layer.

Abstract: Cost-effective materials are essential for large-scale deployment. The
emerging magnetocaloric hydrogen liquefaction technology could transform the
liquid hydrogen industry due to its potential in achieving higher efficiency.
Most studies of the cryogenic magnetocaloric effect (MCE) have focused on
resource-critical rare-earth-based compounds. Here we report on an ionic
magnetocaloric compound FeCl$_2$ which is based on ultralow-cost elements, as a
candidate working material for hydrogen liquefaction. FeCl$_2$ shows both
inverse and conventional MCE. From 0 to 1.5 T, the inverse effect yields a
positive magnetic entropy change ($\Delta S_T$) of about 5 J/kg/K near 20 K,
then declines toward zero at higher fields. In contrast, the conventional
(negative) response strengthens with field. The $\Delta S_T$ reaches 18.6
J/kg/K near 20 K in magnetic fields of 5 T. This value exceeds most light
rare-earth-based compounds and approaches that of heavy rare-earth-based
compounds. In magnetic fields of 5 T, the adiabatic temperature change reaches
about 3.6 K. The large $\Delta S_T$, along with the low cost of the elements in
FeCl$_2$, are prerequisites for inexpensive industrial-scale production, giving
the prospect of a practical magnetocaloric candidate for hydrogen liquefaction
in the 20 $\sim$ 77 K temperature window.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The 3D microstructure of solid oxide fuel cell anodes significantly
influences their electrochemical performance, but conventional methods for
acquiring high-resolution microstructural 3D data such as focused ion beam
scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) are costly in both time and resources.
In contrast, obtaining 2D images, such as from scanning electron microscopy
(SEM), is more accessible, though typically providing insufficient information
to accurately characterize the 3D microstructure. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel approach that predicts the 3D microstructure from 2D SEM
images. The presented method utilizes a low-parametric 3D model from stochastic
geometry to generate a large number of virtual 3D microstructures and employs a
physics-based SEM simulation tool to obtain the corresponding 2D SEM images. By
systematically varying the underlying model parameters, a large dataset can be
generated to train convolutional neural networks (CNNs). By doing so, we can
statistically reconstruct the 3D microstructure from 2D SEM images by drawing
realizations from the stochastic 3D model using the predicted model parameters.
In addition, we conducted an error analysis on key geometrical descriptors to
quantitatively evaluate the accuracy and reliability of this stereological
prediction tool.

Abstract: Nickel based superalloys display outstanding properties such as excellent
creep strength, remarkable fracture toughness parameters, and corrosion
resistance. For this reason, Ni based materials are considered as materials
dedicated to the IV generation of nuclear reactors. Although these materials
seem promising candidates, their radiation resistance and impact of radiation
damage on the deformation mechanism are still not fully understood. In this
work, two commercially available nickel based alloys, Hastelloy X and Haynes
230, were investigated. Structural and mechanical properties have been
described by means of SEM and EBSD, TEM, and nanoindentation tests. Radiation
damage has been performed by Ar ion with energy 320keV with two doses up to
12dpa. Obtained results have revealed a hardening effect for both levels of
damage. However, more intensive effects were observed for Hastelloy X.
Moreover, a significant change in precipitates morphology in Hastelloy X has
been observed. It has been proposed that structural differences between both
alloys determine the type of occurring radiation induced processes. Excess
energy deposited into materials structure during ion irradiation can lower the
temperature of nucleation of high temperature phases, which initiates the
formation of grain boundary serrations.

Abstract: The electrochemical performance of the spinel LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4, a high-voltage
positive electrode material for Li-ion batteries, is influenced by the
transition metal arrangement in the octahedral network, leading to disordered
(Fd m S.G.) and ordered3 (P4332 S.G.) structures. However, widely used
techniques lack the spatial resolution necessary to elucidate the ordering
phenomenon at the particle scale. Using the 4D-STEM technique, we present the
first direct observation of ordering distribution in individual LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4
particles with nanometric spatial resolution. We propose a quantification
method for the local degree of ordering based on the ratio of ordered to
disordered spinel lattices along the particle thickness extracted from electron
diffraction spot intensities. In an ordered spinel LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4, the
transition metal ordering is consistently observed throughout the primary
particle. However, the extent of ordering in the spinel phase depends on its
distribution at the particle scale, a factor influenced by the annealing
conditions. The 4D-STEM analysis elucidates the boundary between highly-ordered
and low-ordered LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 particles.

Abstract: Resonant Inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) is a synchrotron-based
spectroscopy that has seen growing interest across a range of scientific
disciplines beyond fundamental physics. The interpretation of experimental RIXS
data requires theoretical calculations based on the Kramers-Heisenberg formula.
However, due to the dependence of RIXS on both the incident and scattered
photon properties, a tractable treatment of the angular dependence in this
formula has been lacking. In this work, within the electric dipole
approximation, we determine the number of fundamental spectra contributing to
the RIXS cross-section for all crystallographic point groups. We then derive a
general expression for the RIXS cross-section of isotropic samples such as
un-textured powders, homogeneous glasses or liquids, explicitly accounting for
the polarization and propagation directions of both the incident and scattered
photons. Simplified forms of the RIXS expressions are subsequently obtained for
most common point groups. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our
formalism through a case study of uranium 3d4f RIXS.

Abstract: Analyzing the consequences of the quantum geometry induced by the momentum
dependence of Bloch states has emerged as a very rich and active field in
condensed matter physics. For instance, for the superfluid stiffness or the
pairing mechanism, these geometric aspects can play an important role. We here
demonstrate that quantum geometry can also be essential for the disorder
sensitivity of a superconductor, in particular when time-reversal symmetry is
broken in the normal-state Bloch Hamiltonian. We derive a general expression
for the behavior of the critical temperature $T_c$ involving weighted
(anti-)commutators of the superconducting order parameter and impurity matrix
elements, which includes both wave-function effects and kinetic pair breaking
due to broken time-reversal symmetry in the dispersion. We analyze how the
former effects lead to "quantum geometric pair breaking", where any
superconductor becomes susceptible to microscopically non-magnetic impurities,
and formally relate it to the maximum possible localization of two-particle
Wannier states. Further, in the presence of kinetic pair breaking, impurities
can also enhance pairing, leading to an overall more complex, non-monotonic
behavior of $T_c$ with impurity concentration. We also analyze the fate of
finite-momentum pairing. Our results are directly relevant to rhombohedral
graphene, twisted MoTe$_2$, and superconducting altermagnets.

Abstract: This first-principles study investigates the structural, electronic, lattice
dynamical properties, and electron-phonon coupling in ferromagnetic cubic B20
FeGe under applied pressure. The implemented spin-scaling exchange-correlation
(ssxc) approach allowed to modify the magnetic moment and ferromagnetic phase
energetics using a single scaling parameter, thereby yielding an adjustment of
the critical pressure ($p_c$) to its experimental value. The ssxc scheme
resulted in a subtle energy shift of the electronic bands in the spin-up
channel, and reduced the magnetic moment, bringing it closer to the
experimentally reported value. Application of the ssxc approach to phonon
dispersion and electron-phonon interaction resulted in a slight mitigation of
the pronounced softening and large linewidths of the lowest-frequency acoustic
branch close to the $R$-point, typically observed with standard DFT
calculations. With increasing pressure, phonon anomaly and linewidths diminish
significantly and practically disappear at $p_c$ and beyond. This trend
parallels the pressure dependence of the magnetic moment. A comparative
analysis of the electronic joint density of states with the phonon linewidths
revealed that the momentum dependence of linewidths around the $R$-point
closely follow the momentum dependence of the electron-phonon matrix elements.
This indicates that the correlation between magnetic moment and linewidths
under applied pressure originates from the electron-phonon matrix elements,
presenting a distinct scenario compared to other B20 family members, where
nesting plays a more dominating role.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Tantalum (Ta) has recently emerged as a promising low-loss material, enabling
record coherence times in superconducting qubits. This enhanced performance is
largely attributed to its stable native oxide, which is believed to host fewer
two-level system (TLS) defects key $-$ contributors to decoherence in
superconducting circuits. Nevertheless, aluminum oxide (AlO$_x$) remains the
predominant choice for Josephson junction barriers in most qubit architectures.
In this study, we systematically investigate various techniques for forming
high-quality oxide layers on $\alpha$-phase tantalum ($\alpha$-Ta) thin films,
aiming to develop effective Josephson junction barriers. We explore thermal
oxidation in a tube furnace, rapid thermal annealing, as well as plasma
oxidation of both room-temperature and heated Ta films, and propose a
mechanistic picture of the underlying oxidation mechanisms. All methods yield
Ta$_2$O$_5$, the same compound as tantalum's native oxide. Among these, plasma
oxidation produces the smoothest and highest-quality oxide layers, making it
particularly well-suited for Josephson junction fabrication. Furthermore, we
demonstrate the successful epitaxial growth of $\alpha$-Ta atop oxidized
$\alpha$-Ta films, paving the way for the realization of trilayer Ta/Ta-O/Ta
Josephson junctions with clean, low-loss interfaces.

Abstract: A range of of unusual emergent behaviors have been reported in the
charge-density wave (CDW) state of the $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A=~$K, Rb, Cs) kagome
metals, including a CDW formation process without soft phonons, which points to
an unconventional CDW mechanism. Here, we use inelastic x-ray scattering to
show that the CDW in KV$_3$Sb$_5$ forms via phonons that soften to zero energy
at the CDW ordering vector ($L$-point) around $T_{\rm CDW}=78$~K. These soft
phonons exhibit a remarkable in-plane anisotropy, extending over a much larger
momentum range along $L$-$A$ relative to $L$-$H$, which leads to diffuse
scattering common among $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$. Using first-principles calculations, we
find that the momentum-dependent electron-phonon coupling (EPC) is peaked at
$L$ and exhibits the same in-plane anisotropy as the phonon softening.
Conversely, the electronic susceptibility is not peaked at $L$ and shows the
opposite in-plane anisotropy. Our findings favor momentum-dependent EPC as the
driving mechanism of the CDW in KV$_3$Sb$_5$, with a CDW formation process
similar to that of transition metal dichalcogenides.

Abstract: Kitaev chain is a one-dimensional spinless fermion model that has $p$-wave
superconducting (SC) states and Majorana zero modes at the edge. Usually this
model is analyzed by taking only SC order parameter (OP) into account, but the
situation significantly changes when OPs other than the SCOP are included. It
turns out that the SC state in the latter case is prone to phase separation for
moderate to strong attractiive interactions.

Abstract: We investigate electron transport and phase-breaking processes in thin
titanium nitride (TiN) films of epitaxial quality. Previous studies show that a
minute surface magnetic disorder significantly reduces the critical temperature
($T_\mathrm{c}$) and broadens the superconducting transition as the film
thickness and device size decrease. We measure electron dephasing rates via
magnetoresistance from $T_\mathrm{c}$ to $\sim 4T_\mathrm{c}$ in
various-thickness TiN films. Electron dephasing occurs on the picosecond
timescale and is nearly independent of temperature, differing from the expected
inelastic scattering due to the electron-phonon and electron-electron
interactions near $T_\mathrm{c}$, which occur over a nanosecond timescale. We
propose spin-flip scattering as a possible additional phase-breaking mechanism.
The significant increase in the dephasing rate for the thinnest film indicates
that magnetic disorder resides near the surface of naturally oxidized films.
Our research suggests that magnetic disorder may be a significant contributor
to RF dissipation in superconducting devices based on TiN.

Abstract: We theoretically study nonperturbative strong-coupling phenomena in cavity
magnonics systems in which the uniform magnetization dynamics (magnons) in a
ferromagnet is coupled to the microwave magnetic field (photons) of a single LC
resonator. Starting from an effective circuit model that accounts for the
magnetization dynamics described by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, we
show that a nontrivial frequency shift emerges in the ultrastrong and
deep-strong coupling regimes, whose microscopic origin remains elusive within a
purely classical framework. The circuit model is further quantized to derive a
minimal quantum mechanical model for generic cavity magnonics, which
corresponds to a two-mode version of the Hopfield Hamiltonian and explains the
mechanism of the frequency shifts found in the {\it classical} circuit model.
We also formulate the relation between the frequency shift and quantum
quantities, such as the ground-state particle number, quantum fluctuations
associated with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, and entanglement entropy,
providing a nondestructive means to experimentally access to these quantum
resources. By utilizing soft magnons in an anisotropic ferromagnet, we further
demonstrate that these quantum quantities diverge at the zeros of the magnon
band edges as a function of the external magnetic field. This work paves the
way for cavity magnonics beyond the conventional strong coupling regime.

Abstract: The missing first Shapiro step in microwave-irradiated Josephson junctions
has been widely interpreted as a hallmark of Majorana bound states. However,
conventional mechanisms like junction underdamping or Joule heating can produce
similar signatures. Here, we demonstrate that the intrinsic non-linear
current-voltage characteristic of low-to-moderate transparency junctions can
also suppress the first step, accompanied by distinctive zigzag boundaries
between the zeroth and first step at intermediate driving frequencies.
Microwave measurements on Al/WTe2 junctions and numerical simulations of a
non-linear resistively and capacitively shunted junction model reveal the first
step collapse induced by switching jumps of current, together with zigzag
features absent in scenarios solely driven by finite \b{eta} or Joule heating.
This zigzag signature therefore provides a crucial diagnostic tool, emphasizing
the necessity of comprehensive analysis of microwave spectra before attributing
the absence of the first Shapiro step to Majorana physics.

Abstract: We investigate the second-order anomalous Hall response in two-dimensional
higher-wave-symmetric magnets, including the recently discovered class of
collinear magnets known as altermagnets, when subjected to a symmetry-breaking
external electric field. In these systems, the first- and second-order
anomalous Hall responses mediated by the first- and second-order multipoles of
the Berry curvature over the occupied states vanish by symmetry. However, a
symmetry-breaking dc electric field can induce a nonzero Berry curvature dipole
by coupling to a nonvanishing quantum metric, also known as the Berry
connection polarizability. An applied ac electric field can then generate a
finite nonlinear transverse Hall effect characterized by a second harmonic
response. We discuss this remarkable effect in a class of
higher-order-symmetric unconventional magnets (of $p$, $d$, $f$, $g$, $i$
symmetry), including the subclass of altermagnets. We demonstrate that the
electric-field-induced anomalous Hall effect in the higher-wave-symmetric
magnets can serve not only as a probe of the underlying quantum metric of the
occupied states but also as a means to distinguish the even ($d$-,$g$-wave) and
odd ($p$-wave) order parameter symmetries defined on the square lattice.

Abstract: A superlattice of multilayer graphene and hBN has proven to be a promising
pathway for engineering electronic band structures and topologies. In this
work, we experimentally demonstrate the role of hBN alignment in inducing
topological band reconstruction in bilayer graphene (BLG) superlattices. Our
study establishes that while the primary band retains its massive chiral naure,
the secondary bands host massless, chiral fermions. Magnetotransport
measurements, including Quantum Hall, temperature-dependent Shubnikov-de Haas
oscillations, and Berry phase analysis, confirm the distinct topological nature
of these bands. A significantly reduced Fermi velocity in the moir\'{e}
secondary band indicates band flattening induced by the moir\'{e} potential.
Our study provides a pathway for controlling topological quantum transport in
BLG/hBN superlattices.

Abstract: We investigate the thermoelectric transport properties of an interacting
parallel double quantum dot in the Coulomb-blockade regime. Building on an
analytical solution based on an equation-of-motion technique, we extend the
formalism for the asymmetrically coupled situation and provide compact
closed-form expressions for steady-state currents together with the
differential conductance, Seebeck coefficient, and thermal conductance. We
determine the operating points that maximize efficiency and output power of the
system, clarifying their relation to standard near-equilibrium ZT expressions.
We further study the thermal rectification in both the open- and closed-circuit
configurations and derive an expression for the open-circuit case.
Interaction-induced resonances are understood in terms of the poles of the
resulting Green's function, generating gate and bias dependent regions of
enhanced efficiency at finite power, negative differential thermal conductance,
and finite thermal rectification.

Abstract: Electron magnetic circular dichroism (EMCD) in transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) enables element-specific measurement of spin and orbital
magnetic moments, analogous to X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD). While
the EMCD technique offers unmatched spatial resolution, its quantitative
accuracy remains under scrutiny, particularly in beam-splitter geometries with
convergent probes. Here, we systematically evaluate the limits of quantitative
EMCD analysis using the first-order magnetostructural transition in the
functional phase-change material FeRh as a tunable magnetic reference. Unlike
previous EMCD studies primarily focused on elemental ferromagnets such as Fe,
we demonstrate its applicability to a correlated material exhibiting coupled
structural and magnetic order. We demonstrate that the extracted
orbital-to-spin moment ratio ($m_\text{L}/m_\text{S}$) remains consistent with
XMCD benchmarks for TEM probes down to approximately 6 nm, thereby establishing
the validity range for reliable quantification. For nm-sized probes with higher
convergence angles, we observe an enhanced $m_\text{L}/m_\text{S}$, which we
attribute to a combination of instrumental factors and sensitivity to nanoscale
heterogeneity within the probed volume. Our results confirm that EMCD provides
quantitative agreement with macroscale techniques under suitable conditions,
while uniquely enabling spatially confined measurements of local magnetic
moments in functional magnetic materials, and allowing the study of
interfacial, defect-mediated, or phase-separated magnetism that is inaccessible
to photon-based methods.

Abstract: Protecting qubits from perturbations is a central challenge in quantum
computing. Topological superconductors with separated Majorana bound states
(MBSs) provide a strong form of protection that only depends on the locality of
perturbations. While the link between MBS separation, robust degeneracy, and
protected braiding is well understood in non-interacting systems, recent
experimental progress in short quantum-dot-based Kitaev chains highlights the
need to establish these connections rigorously for interacting systems. We do
this by defining MBSs from many-body ground states and show how their locality
constrains their coupling to an environment. This, in turn, quantifies the
protection of the energy degeneracy and the feasibility of non-abelian
braiding.

Abstract: We use a braiding nonequilibrium fluctuation dissipation relation linking the
DC noise to the response function inferred from the braiding constraint in the
time-domain with a phase $\theta$ within the UNEPT (Unified Non equilibrium
Perturbative Theory). By applying the Kramers-Kr\"onig relations, we obtain an
integral equation connecting DC current and noise that involves $\theta$. By
specifying to thermal states so that noise is Poissonian, we find an analytical
solution for the DC current via the Wiener-Hopf technique. It reveals that the
time-braiding phase is determined by the scaling dimension~$\delta$. This
questions the universality of $\theta$ that can reflect the microscopic edge
dynamics, in contrast to the topologically protected braiding phase in the
space domain.

Abstract: Molecular-scale materials with bistable behavior and tunable properties are
increasingly relevant for next-generation nanoscale electronic devices. Helical
foldamers are promising candidates, but their structural and mechanical
properties are highly sensitive to conformational stability and environmental
conditions. A systematic methodology based on quantum-chemical calculations is
proposed for assessing solvent-dependent mechanical behavior, combining
analysis of $\pi-\pi$ stacking interactions, conformational energetics, and
environmental effects. Using this methodology we identified simple design
principles for the rapid screening of new compounds, allowing evaluation of
their conformational stability and effective mechanical rigidity. Applying
these principles, we identify a modified helical aromatic foldamer that
exhibits improved mechanical and stability characteristics compared to the
initial reference compound.

Abstract: We demonstrate that conductance anomalies can arise in a clean, adiabatic
quantum point contact when a channel is partially open. Even for a smooth
barrier potential, backscattering induces Friedel oscillations that, via
electron interactions, generate a singular correction to the conductance. This
correction is maximized when the channel is half-open, resulting in a reduction
of conductance. In addition, a magnetic field applied perpendicular to the
spin-orbit axis modifies the single-particle spectrum, resulting in conductance
oscillations via Fabry-P\'erot-type interference, as well as a non-monotonic
field dependence of the anomaly. Our findings reveal a universal mechanism by
which interactions modify the conductance of an ideal partially open channel
and offer a possible explanation for the anomalous features observed in
experiments.

Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments on rhombohedral stacked multilayer graphene
and the observation of the anomalous Hall effect in a spontaneous spin-valley
polarized quarter metal state, we calculate the anomalous Hall conductivity for
this system in the presence of two types of impurities: weak and dense as well
as sparse and strong. Our calculation of $\sigma_{xy}$ is based on the
Kubo-Streda diagrammatic approach. In a model with Gaussian disorder applicable
to weak dense impurities, this involves all non-crossing diagrams (intrinsic,
side-jump and Gaussian skew-scattering contributions) and additionally diagrams
with two intersecting impurities, X and $\Psi$, representing diffractive
skew-scattering processes. A "Mercedes star" diagram (non-Gaussian skew
scattering) is furthermore included to treat in the case of strong, sparse
impurities. We supplement our asymptotically exact analytical solutions for an
isotropic model without warping effects by semi-numerical calculations
accounting perturbatively for warping, which plays a crucial role in the
low-energy band structure.

Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments, here we identify valley-coherent
charge-density wave (VC-CDW) order in the non-degenerate quarter-metal for the
entire family of chirally-stacked $n$ layer graphene, encompassing rhombohedral
multi-layer, Bernal bilayer, and monolayer cousins. Besides the hallmark broken
translational symmetry, yielding a modulated charge-density over an enlarged
unit-cell with a characteristic $2{\bf K}$ periodicity, where $\pm {\bf K}$ are
the valley momenta, this phase lacks the three-fold ($C_3$) rotational symmetry
but only for even integer $n$. The VC-CDW then represents a stripe order, as
observed in hexalayer graphene [arXiv:2504.05129], but preserves the $C_3$
symmetry for odd $n$ as observed in trilayer graphene [Nat. Phys. 20, 1413
(2024) and arXiv: 2411.11163]. From a universal Clifford algebraic argument, we
establish that the VC-CDW and an anomalous Hall order can lift the residual
valley degeneracy of an antiferromagnetically ordered spin-polarized
half-metal, when these systems are subject to perpendicular displacement
fields, with only the latter one displaying a hysteresis in off-diagonal
resistivity, as observed in all the systems with $2 \leq n \leq 6$. We showcase
a confluence of VC-CDW and anomalous Hall orders within the quarter-metal,
generically displaying a regime of coexistence, separating the pure phases.
