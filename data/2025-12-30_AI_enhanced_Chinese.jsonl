In this work, we investigate the magnetic properties of the alternating monolayer-trilayer phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (1313-La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$) using muon-spin rotation/relaxation ($\u03bc$SR) under both ambient and hydrostatic pressure conditions. The monolayer-trilayer phase develops incommensurate magnetic order below approximately 150 K, with a mean ordering temperature of $T_{SDW} \\simeq 123$ K and a transition width of $\u0394T_{SDW} \\simeq 15$ K. The abrupt onset of the internal magnetic field indicates a first-order-like transition. Hydrostatic pressure ($p$) suppresses the magnetic ordering temperature at a rate of $dT_{SDW}/d p \\simeq -3.9$ K/GPa, demonstrating a progressive destabilization of the ordered state. By comparison with the bilayer 2222-La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and the trilayer 3333-La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ systems, and within a unified phenomenological framework, systematic trends are identified linking the pressure dependence of $T_{SDW}$, the (in)commensurability of the magnetic order, and the character of the magnetic transition. These trends consistently indicate a gradual reduction of electronic correlation strength from the bilayer to the monolayer-trilayer and trilayer nickelates. This hierarchy suggests that the higher superconducting transition temperature observed in the 2222 phase may be closely connected to its more strongly correlated electronic nature. These results position the alternating monolayer-trilayer 1313-La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ as an intermediate member linking the magnetic behavior of the bilayer 2222-La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and the trilayer 3333-La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ Ruddlesden-Popper compounds.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We reveal that an interplay between quasiperiodicity and topology drives TTG into a critical regime, enabling it to host superconductivity with rigid phase stiffness for a wide range of twist angles, rather than at a fine-tuned value. The criticality in the normal state is due to the Dirac fermions coupled by quasiperiodic tunneling simulating 3D topological superconductor surface states. This critical-metal regime is marked by multifractal wave functions across the spectrum and scale-invariant transport reminiscent of the integer quantum Hall plateau transition. We demonstrate this with large-scale wave function and Kubo conductivity calculations.

Characterizing these defects is an important step towards reducing their impact and improving qubit coherence. The identification of individual defects requires atomic-scale spatial resolution, however, and sufficient spectral sensitivity to determine their electronic structure. Electrostatic force microscopy (EFM) provides highly resolved maps of the surface potential of dielectrics, and importantly, is also sensitive to single-electron charging processes that reflect the spectral structure of underlying defects. In this work, we use cryogenic EFM to characterize aluminum oxide grown by atomic layer deposition (ALD) on bulk silicon. These measurements reveal defects close to the surface that exchange electrons with the EFM tip as they transition through different charge states. Detailed electrostatic modeling opens the door to powerful techniques for mapping tip-backgate charging voltages onto defect transition energies, allowing defects such as aluminum vacancies, and carbon, oxygen, or hydrogen impurities to be identified, by comparing to density functional theory (DFT).

The lattice constants obtained using the SCAN and PBEsol functionals show good agreement with experimental data. The cubic phase exhibits a direct band gap of 1.66 to 1.78 eV, while the hexagonal phase shows a band gap of 1.48 to 1.59 eV, as confirmed by mBJ and HSE06 calculations.

The optical absorption coefficient reaches 1e6 cm-1, which is comparable to or higher than values reported for other III V semiconductors. The Seebeck coefficient exceeds 1500 microV per K under intrinsic conditions, and the thermoelectric performance improves above 600 K due to enhanced phonon scattering and lattice anharmonicity.

This approach seeks to merge benefits of superconducting and semiconductor qubits, for instance by encoding quantum information in the spin of a quasiparticle occupying an Andreev bound state, thus combining long coherence times with fast, flexible control. Progress has accelerated through bottom-up engineering of Andreev states in coupled quantum dot arrays, leading to architectures such as minimal Kitaev chains hosting Majorana zero modes. In parallel, Hamiltonian-protected designs aim to enhance resilience against local noise and decoherence by exploiting superconducting phase dynamics and discrete charge or flux degrees of freedom. This article reviews recent theoretical and experimental advances in hybrid qubits, providing an overview of physical mechanisms, device implementations, and emerging architectures, with emphasis on their potential for (topologically) protected quantum information processing. While many designs remain at proof-of-concept stage, rapid progress suggests practical demonstrations may soon be achievable.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Specifically, the dynamics of lattice vibrations, or phonons, have attracted interest because of their hypothesized ability to facilitate superionic conduction. However, direct experimental measurement of the role of phonons in ionic conduction is challenging due to the fast intrinsic timescales of ion hopping and the difficulty of driving relevant phonon modes, which often lie in the low-energy THz regime. To overcome these limitations, we use laser-driven ultrafast impedance spectroscopy (LUIS). LUIS resonantly excites phonons using a THz field and probes ion hopping with picosecond time resolution. We apply LUIS to understand the dynamical role of phonons in $Li_7La_3Zr_2O_{12}$ (LLZO). When in its cubic phase (c-LLZO), this garnet-type solid electrolyte has an ionic conductivity two orders of magnitude greater than its tetragonal phase (t-LLZO). T-LLZO is characterized by an ordered and filled $Li^+$ sublattice necessitating synchronous ion hopping. In contrast, c-LLZO is characterized by a disordered and vacancy-rich $Li^+$ sublattice, and has a conduction mechanism dominated by single hops. We find that, upon excitation of phonons in the 0.5-7.5 THz range, the impedance of t-LLZO experiences a longer ion hopping decay signal in comparison to c-LLZO. The results suggest that phonon-mediated ionic conduction by THz modes may lead to larger ion displacements in ordered and fully occupied mobile ion sublattices as opposed to those that are disordered and vacancy-rich. Overall, this work highlights the interplay between static and dynamic factors that enables improved ionic conductivity in otherwise poorly conducting inorganic solids.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Here we instead analyse the even-parity sector, i.e., the Andreev pair qubit based on Andreev bound states (ABS). The model is solved using the zero-bandwidth approximation and the numerical renormalization group, with further insight from variational calculations. Electron-electron interaction admixes single-occupancy Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) components into the ABS states, thereby strongly enhancing spin transitions in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. The ABS states can thus become sensitive to local magnetic field fluctuations, which has implications for decoherence in Andreev pair qubits.

The distinct adsorption distances measured emphasize surface heterogeneity and porosity. Taken together, these atomistic insights corroborate experimental observations and yield actionable guidance for the rational design of biochars for remediation of anionic herbicides, highlighting how surface functionality and solution chemistry can be tuned to optimize sorption.

This goes beyond the Kuramoto framework owing to inherent nonreciprocity and dynamically evolving effective couplings, leading to static and dynamical ferromagnetic and (anti)vortex states with nontrivial phase winding. Most strikingly, we identify an ac phase characterized by the emergence of two distinct frequencies, which spontaneously break the time-translation symmetry: one associated with the precession of the global U(1) Goldstone mode and the other with a stabilized limit cycle in a five-dimensional phase space. This phase features bias-free autonomous oscillatory currents beyond conventional Josephson dynamics. We further examine how instabilities develop in the ferromagnetic and vortex states, and how they drive transitions into the ac regime.

However, this structural description appears to be ineffective for new families of materials such as high entropy alloys (HEAs), which combine crystallographic order with chemical disorder. Here, we demonstrate for five-element HEAs as pure solid solutions that the chemical disorder of the elements decorating their cubic structure underlies the generation of second optical harmonics, overcoming the theoretical limit imposed on centrosymmetric crystals. Moreover, we discover that this disorder, inherent to HEAs, sets a threshold for non-linear light emission from the 4th to the 26th order. As a consequence of the 0.5 eV broadening of the energy levels of the five elements of the HEA, the emission spectrum covers broad visible (400-650 nm) and infrared (800-1600 nm) ranges. In addition to the challenge of theoretically predicting non-linear effects in unconventional materials, the duality of structural order and chemical disorder in HEAs offers the opportunity to design sustainable alternatives to urgently needed optical materials.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, current simulation methods are usually too complex to give the needed accuracy and timeliness when a large amount of data need to be analyzed, such as for in-situ characterization of battery materials. To address these problems, artificial intelligence (AI) models have been developed for XANES prediction. However, instead of using experimental XANES data, the existing models are trained using simulated data, resulting in significant discrepancies between the predicted and experimental spectra. Also, the universality across different elements has not been well studied for such models. In this work, we firstly establish a crystal graph neural network, pre-trained on simulated XANES data covering 48 elements, to achieve universal XANES prediction with a low average relative square error of 0.020223; and then utilize transfer learning to calibrate the model using a small experimental XANES dataset. After calibration, the edge energy misalignment error of the predicted S, Ti and Fe K edge XANES is significantly reduced by about 55%. The method demonstrated in this work opens up a new way to achieve fast, universal, and experiment-calibrated XANES prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We collected ~30 TB 4D datasets which allow us to elucidate the phases' co-growth dynamics and their spatial, crystallographic and compositional relationship. The primary Al4Mn hexagonal prisms nucleate and grow with high kinetic anisotropy -70 times faster in the axial direction than the radial direction. In all cases, a ~5 um Mn-rich diffusion layer forms at the liquid-solid interface, creating a sharp local solute gradient that governs subsequent phase transformation. The peritectic Al6Mn phases nucleate epitaxially within this diffusion zone, initially forming a thin shell surrounding the Al4Mn with an orientation relationship of {10-10}HCP // {110}O, [0001]HCP // [001]O. Such ~5 um Mn-rich diffusion layers also cause solute depletion at the liquid side of the liquid-solid interface, limiting further epitaxial phase growth, but prompting phase re-nucleation and branching at crystal edges, resulting tetragonal prism structures that no longer follow the initial orientation relationship. The anisotropic diffusion also led to the formation of core defects at the centre of both phases. Furthermore, increasing cooling rate from 0.17 to 20 \u00b0C/s can disrupt the stability of the solute diffusion zone, effectively suppressing the formation of the core defects and forcing a transition from faceted to non-faceted morphologies. Our work establishes a new theoretical framework for how to tailor and control the peritectic structures in metallic alloys through solidification processes.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Despite their importance, the molecular mechanisms driving their friction-reducing effects remain unclear, especially for phosphate esters, whose molecular structure critically impact tribological behavior. In this study, we use machine learning-based molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the tribological performance of three representative phosphorus-based additives, Dibutyl Hydrogen Phosphite (DBHP), Octyl Acid Phosphate (OAP), and Methyl Polyethylene Glycol Phosphate (mPEG-P), on iron surfaces. The mPEG-P family is further analyzed by varying esterification degree and chain length. DBHP exhibits the lowest friction and largest interfacial separation, resulting from steric hindrance and tribochemical reactivity, as indicated by P-O bond cleavage and enhanced O-Fe interactions. In contrast, OAP and mPEG-P monoesters produce higher friction due to limited steric protection and reduced resistance to shear, leading to partial loss of surface coverage under extreme conditions. Within the mPEG-P family, multi-ester and longer-chain molecules significantly lower friction by maintaining larger separations, demonstrating that steric effects can outweigh surface reactivity under severe confinement. Overall, these results provide atomistic insights into how molecular architecture controls additive performance and support the design of phosphorus-based lubricants combining reactive anchoring with optimized steric structures for durable, low-friction interfaces.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Traditionally, altermagnets are distinguished from collinear antiferromagnets using the central concept of halving subgroups within the spin space group formalism. In this work, we propose the Fundamental Lemma of Altermagnetism (FLAM) deriving the exact conditions required for the existence of altermagnetic phase in a magnetic material on the basis of site-symmetry groups and halving subgroups for a given crystallographic space group. The spin group formalism further clubs ferrimagnetism with ferromagnetism since the same-spin and opposite-spin sublattices lose their meaning in the presence of multiple magnetic species. As a consequence of FLAM, we further propose a class of fully compensated ferrimagnets, termed as Alterferrimagnets (AFiMs), which can show alternating momentum-dependent spin-polarized non-relativistic electronic bands within the first Brillouin zone. We show that alterferrimagnetism is a generalization of traditional collinear altermagnetism where multiple magnetic species are allowed to coexist forming fully compensated magnetic-sublattices, each with individual up-spin and down-spin sublattices.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, the dynamical stability of this undistorted phase has not previously been questioned. It is important to establish whether other lower-symmetry structures are energetically more favorable because octahedral rotations control electronic bandwidths and constrain which magnetic interactions are allowed by symmetry. Here I compute first-principles phonon dispersions of $I4/mmm$ Ba$_2$IrO$_4$ including spin-orbit interaction. I find a nearly-flat nondegenerate unstable branch along the Brillouin-zone boundary segment $XP$ associated with inplane rotations of the IrO$_6$ octahedra. Using group-theoretical analysis, I enumerate the symmetry-allowed distortions associated with the $X_2^+$ and $P_4$ instabilities and fully relax the resulting structures. Only five of the twelve possible distortions can be stabilized, and the energy gain scales with the number of layers that exhibit octahedral rotations: phases with rotations in every IrO$_6$ layer are lower by $-5.8$ meV/atom and are nearly degenerate with respect to the stacking phase. Electronic structure calculations show that these rotated phases host a narrow and well-separated half-filled $J_{\\textrm{eff}} = 1/2$ manifold, whereas structures with rotations only in alternate layers have broader and more entangled bands. This motivates a reinvestigation of the crystal structure of Ba$_2$IrO$_4$ and indicates that octahedral rotations should be considered in modeling its correlated electronic and magnetic properties.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
