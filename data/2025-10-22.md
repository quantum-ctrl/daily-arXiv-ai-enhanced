Abstract: Persistent current is a hallmark of quantum phase coherence. We study the
fate of the persistent current in a non-equilibrium setting, where a
tight-binding ring is subjected to stochastic disorder as well as a fermionic
reservoir attached to each site. We evaluate the current using Keldysh
technique and find that it exhibits non-monotonic behavior, suggesting two
distinct mechanisms of decoherence. While coupling to the reservoirs introduces
a coherence length scale given by the inverse of the coupling strength, the
other mechanism is more subtle and driven by the ratio of noise strength to
reservoir coupling. The interplay of noise and reservoir constitutes a purely
non-equilibrium steady state with a flatter distribution function that we
effectively describe using classical rate equations. We discuss possibilities
of realizing our findings in ultracold-atom experiments.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We show that skyrmions can exhibit what we call a magnetic diode effect,
where there is a nonreciprocal response in the transport when the magnetic
field is reversed. This effect can be achieved for skyrmions moving in a
channel with a sawtooth potential on one side and a reversed sawtooth potential
on the other side. We consider the cases of both spin-transfer torque (STT) and
spin-orbit torque (SOT) driving. When the magnetic field is held fixed, the
velocity response of the skyrmion is the same for current applied in either
direction for both STT and SOT driving, so there is no current diode effect.
When the magnetic field is reversed, under STT driving the velocity of the
skyrmion reverses and its absolute value changes. Under SOT driving, the
velocity remains in the same direction but drops to a much lower value,
resulting in negative differential conductivity. For a fixed current, we find a
nonreciprocal skyrmion velocity as a function of positive and negative applied
fields, in analogy to the velocity-current curves observed in the usual diode
effect. The nonreciprocity is generated by the Magnus force, which causes
skyrmions to interact preferentially with one side of the channel. Since the
channel sides have opposite asymmetry, a positive magnetic field can cause the
skyrmion to interact with the "hard" asymmetry side of the channel, while a
negative magnetic field causes the skyrmion to interact with the easy asymmetry
side. This geometry could be used to create new kinds of magnetic-field-induced
diode effects that can be harnessed in new types of skyrmion-based devices.

Abstract: Altermagnets provide a new route to engineer superconducting circuits without
magnetic fields. We theoretically study the Andreev bound state (ABS) spectrum
of a finite-width altrmagnet-based Josephson junction and show how the $d$-wave
altermagnetic symmetry and geometric confinement shape its low-energy
excitations. We find a clear distinction between the two $d$-wave symmetries:
$d_{x^2-y^2}$ order produces spin splitting, whereas $d_{xy}$ order preserves
spin degeneracy and exhibits splitting of the ABS spectrum induced by intermode
hybridization. Leveraging these novel features, we propose applying a
transverse electric field to tune the system and realize a magnetic-field-free,
parity-protected superconducting qubit that we call altermon.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We identify a Hall viscosity term directly from the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interaction (DMI), that breaks parity symmetry, in the skyrmion motion of
insulating magnets by time-averaging the magnon contribution to all orders. The
viscosity term is proportional to the skyrmion charge. Skyrmion Hall angle
shows significant dependence on the skyrmion shape and size, the ratio of
exchange over DMI parameters, while roughly independent of the Gilbert damping
parameter. The Hall angles have the same magnitude for opposite skyrmion
charges. We speculate a velocity-dependent Hall viscosity contribution to seek
asymmetric Hall angles for the opposite charges.

Abstract: Antiferromagnets have garnered significant attention due to their negligible
stray field and ultrafast magnetic dynamics, which are promising for
high-density and ultrafast spintronic applications. Their dual functionality as
both spin sources and information carriers could enable all-electrical
self-induced switching of antiferromagnetic order, offering great potential for
ultra-compact spintronic devices. However, related progress is still elusive.
Here, we report the deterministic switching of chiral antiferromagnetic orders
induced by charge current at zero external magnetic field in the van der Waals
(vdW) magnetically intercalated transition metal dichalcogenide CoTa3S6. This
system exhibits strong interactions between cobalt atom magnetic moment lattice
and itinerant electrons within the metallic layers, as demonstrated by
temperature-dependent angle-resolved photoemission, scanning tunneling
spectroscopy, and topological Nernst effect measurements. Notably, the
itinerant-localization interactions lead to current-induced chiral spin orbit
torques as well as Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) exchange torques that
interact with the localized magnetic moments, facilitating all-electrical
switching of the chiral magnetic order in the CoTa3S6 flake. Our work opens a
promising avenue for manipulating antiferromagnetic orders by delicately
engineering the synergistic interactions between magnetic moments and itinerant
electrons.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Edge-functionalized Transition Metal dichalcogenide nanoribbons of the zigzag
type (zTMDCNRs) are explored in terms of their spin transmission properties.
Specifically, systems of the type 5-zWXYNR + nA (X, Y = S, Se; n = 0, 1, 2; A =
H, B, C, N, O), involving five rows of a zWXY unit, are investigated as
transmission elements between semi-infinite electrodes, to identify atomic
adsorbates and adsorption conditions for maximizing the spin polarization of
current traversing the ribbons. Janus counterparts of these units, asymmetric
structures comprising a transition metal layer sandwiched by two different
chalcogen layers, are included in this study. In all cases considered, density
functional theory (DFT) modeling, involving the hybrid Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof
(HSE) exchange-correlation functional, is combined with the non-equilibrium
Green's function (NEGF) approach to determine both spin and charge transport
properties. The effect of the selected atomic absorbates on the geometric,
electronic, and magnetic properties of 5-zWXYNR (X, Y = S, Se) is evaluated. A
protocol to assess the spin-filtering capacity of 5-zWXYNR + nad as a function
of the nature and the density of atomic adsorbates, is formulated in terms of
band structure analysis of the respective electrode units. Spin gaps emerging
close to the Fermi energy of the electrode are shown to provide an effective
predictor for the degree of current spin polarization achieved by any of the
transmission systems studied here. For any adsorbate configuration considered,
ferromagnetic (FM) as well as antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering is examined, and
the impact of the magnetic phase on the spin transport properties is discussed.
A spin-selective negative differential resistance effect is identified for
specific nanoribbon systems.

Abstract: Freestanding van der Waals crystals made of single-atom carbon chains (car-
bynes) have been recently realized technologically. Here we investigate their
electronic and optical properties experimentally, by continuous-wave and time-
resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy, and theoretically. Employing a fully
three-dimensional tight-binding formalism benchmarked against density func-
tional theory calculations we predict the semimetal-semiconductor transition to
occur in van der Waals carbyne crystals composed by the chains of about 42
atoms long. The semiconductor phase is characterized by a hyperbolic van Hove
singularity which gives rise to unconventional hyperbolic exciton states.
Experi- mentally, we access the semiconductor phase, where resonant features
associated with hyperbolic excitons are clearly visible. The exciton oscillator
strength is found to be strongly sensitive to the length of carbon chains: our
experiments show that it decreases with the increasing chain length. This
tendency, con- firmed by the theoretical modeling, manifests the evolution of
the hyperbolic exciton state on the way to the semiconductor-semimetal
crossover. Our approach accounts for the actual crystalline geometry, including
alternating intra-chain hoppings and inter-chain couplings. By fitting
tight-binding dispersions to density functional theory data we extract
consistent parameters and establish a com- prehensive framework for the physics
of carbyne crystals. This study paves the way towards efficient band-gap
engineering in ultimate one-dimensional carbon crystals.

Abstract: In this work, we present a novel investigation into the spin-dependent
thermoelectric performance of an extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model,
showcasing for the first time how its intrinsic spin filtration mechanism can
be strategically harnessed to function as an efficient spin thermoelectric
generator. By introducing a Fibonacci-type aperiodic modulation in the onsite
energies, we engineer a deterministic disorder that mimics realistic aperiodic
systems and profoundly influences transport characteristics. Furthermore, we
incorporate both nearest-neighbor (NN) and next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) hopping
amplitudes with tunable cosine dependencies, enabling us to meticulously
explore the intricate interplay between these hopping processes and its
implications on thermoelectric behavior. Our analysis reveals a remarkable
enhancement in the dimensionless thermoelectric figure of merit ZT for both
charge and spin transport channels, under carefully optimized conditions.
Notably, the spin thermoelectric response exhibits distinct advantages, opening
a new frontier in the design of next-generation thermoelectric materials and
devices. This qualitative study not only deepens our understanding of aperiodic
topological systems but also establish a foundational framework for exploiting
spin-based thermoelectricity in low-dimensional platforms.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Nanoscale engineered spin systems, ranging from spins on surfaces to
nanographenes, provide flexible platforms to realize entangled quantum magnets
from a bottom up approach. However, assessing the quantum many-body Hamiltonian
realized in a specific experiment remains an exceptional open challenge, due to
the difficulty of disentangling competing terms accounting for the many-body
excitations. Here, we demonstrate a machine learning strategy to learn a
quantum many-body spin Hamiltonian from scanning spectroscopy measurements of
spin excitations. Our methodology leverages the spatially-resolved
reconstruction of the many-body excitations induced by depositing quantum
impurities next to the quantum magnet. We demonstrate that our algorithm allows
us to predict long-range Heisenberg exchange interactions, anisotropic
exchange, as well as antisymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, including
in the presence of sizable noise. Our methodology establishes defect-induced
spatially-resolved dynamical excitations in quantum magnets as a powerful
strategy to understand the nature of quantum spin many-body models.

Abstract: We investigate the coupling of a multi-mode metal-insulator-metal cavity to a
two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in a quantum well in the presence of a
strong magnetic field. The TM cavity mode is strongly hybridized with an
intersubband transition of the 2DEG, forming a polaritonic mode in the
ultrastrong coupling regime, while the TE mode remains an almost purely cavity
mode. The magnetoplasmon excitation emerging from the presence of the magnetic
field couples with both TM and TE modes, exhibiting different coupling
strengths and levels of spatial field inhomogeneity. While the strong
homogeneity of the bare TE mode gives rise to the standard anticrossing of
strong coupling, the inhomogeneous polaritonic TM mode is shown to activate an
observable Coulombic effect in the spectral response, often referred to as
non-locality. This experiment demonstrates a cavity-induced modification of the
2DEG response and offers a new route to probing the effect of Coulomb
interactions in ultrastrongly coupled systems via reshaping of their cavity
mode profiles.

Abstract: We demonstrate a finite twist-angle stabilization mechanism in
lattice-mismatched 2D heterobilayers, which results from the geometric
alignment between the flake edges and its moire pattern. Using atomistic
simulations of graphene on hexagonal boron nitride flakes with diameters of up
to $\sim 2500${\AA}, we identify robust metastable angles at $\sim 0.61^\circ$
for armchair and $\sim1.89^\circ$ for zigzag-edged flakes, tunable via in-plane
heterostrain. This locking mechanism, which relies on energy barriers that are
an order of magnitude larger than those of nearby metastable twist angles,
provides a geometric route to precision twist-angle control of two-dimensional
heterostructures and to understand the self-orientation of macroscopic flakes.

Abstract: Semiconductor nanoplatelets possess exceptional optical properties that make
them promising candidates for next-generation optoelectronic applications.
However, unlike quantum dots where absorption spectroscopy alone can determine
both size and concentration, nanoplatelets present a significant
characterization challenge: the absorption peak position reveals only
thickness, providing no information about lateral dimensions or concentration.
This limitation forces researchers to rely on time-consuming and costly
elemental analysis techniques for complete sample characterization. Here, we
present an experimentally verified theoretical framework that predicts the
frequency-dependent absorption coefficient of randomly oriented CdSe, CdS, and
CdTe nanoplatelets, enabling concentration determination from absorption
measurements and lateral size estimates. Our model shows that the integrated
absorption coefficient depends universally on nanoplatelet surface area and
thickness, yielding a practical tool to extract concentrations without
laborious elemental analysis. This approach bridges the characterization gap
between quantum dots and nanoplatelets, offering a streamlined method for rapid
sample analysis that could accelerate nanoplatelet research and applications.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Even small electrostatic potentials can dramatically influence the band
structure of narrow-, broken-, and inverted-gap materials. A quantitative
understanding often necessitates a self-consistent Hartree approach. The
valence and conduction band states strongly hybridize and/or cross in these
systems. This makes distinguishing between electrons and holes impossible and
the assumption of a flat charge carrier distribution at the charge neutrality
point hard to justify. Consequently the wide-gap approach often fails in these
systems. An alternative is the full-band envelope-function approach by Andlauer
and Vogl, which has been implemented into the open-source software package
kdotpy (arXiv:2407.12651). We show that this approach and implementation gives
numerically stable and quantitatively accurate results where the conventional
method fails by modeling the experimental subband density evolution with
top-gate voltage in thick (26 nm - 110 nm), topologically inverted HgTe quantum
wells. We expect our openly-available implementation to greatly benefit the
investigation of narrow-, broken-, and inverted-gap materials.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Fermi arcs represent the surface states at the boundary of a
three-dimensional topological semimetal with the vacuum, illustrating the
notion of bulk-boundary correspondence playing out in real materials. Their
special character is tied up with the topological charges carried by the nodes
of the semimetal in the momentum space, where two or more bands cross. In fact,
they are constrained to begin and end on the perimeters of the projections of
the Fermi surfaces of the bands tangentially, signalling their mixing with the
bulk states. The number of Fermi arcs grazing onto the tangents of the
outermost projection about a given node also reflects the magnitude of the
charge at the node (equalling the Berry-curvature monopole), revealing the
intrinsic topology of the underlying bandstructure, which can be visualised in
experiments like ARPES. Here we take upon the task of unambiguously
characterising the analytical structure of these states for generic nodal
points, (1) whose degeneracy might be twofold or multifold; and (2) the
associated bands might exhibit isotropic or anisotropic, linear- or
nonlinear-in-momentum dispersion. Moreover, we also address the question of
whether we should get any Fermi arcs at all for topological nodes carrying zero
values of monopoles, but representing ideal dipoles.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The Meissner effect, the expulsion of magnetic field from the interior of a
metal entering the superconducting state, is arguably the most fundamental
property of superconductors, discovered in 1933. The conventional theory of
superconductivity developed in 1957 is generally believed to fully explain the
Meissner effect. We will review the arguments that support this consensus,
rooted in the concept of emergence. However, recent work has shown that there
are questions related to momentum conservation in the process of magnetic field
expulsion that have not been addressed within the conventional theory. Within a
reductionist approach, it has been proposed that those questions can only be
resolved by introducing physics that is not part of the conventional theory,
namely that there is radial motion of electric charge in the transition
process. This is consistent with the behavior of classical plasmas, where
motion of magnetic field lines is always associated with motion of charges. We
review how this approach explains puzzles associated with momentum transfer
between electrons and ions in the Meissner effect. Whether or not radial charge
motion is associated with the Meissner effect has fundamental implications
regarding superconductivity mechanisms in materials and regarding strategies to
search for new materials with higher superconducting transition temperatures.
Therefore, adjudication of this question is urgent and important.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Proximity effect in thin-film superconductor (S)/magnet heterostructures with
different types of magnets including ferromagnets, antiferromagnets and
altermagnets is widely considered in the framework of an effective model, where
the heterostructure is replaced by a homogeneous superconductor in the presence
of a homogeneous exchange field of a corresponding type. Here we study the
extent to which such a model is actually applicable to ballistic thin-film
superconductor/magnetic heterostructures. In particular, a comparative analysis
of thin-film superconductor/magnetic metal and superconductor/magnetic
insulator heterostructures is performed. Metallic and insulating ferromagnets
(FM, FI) and altermagnets (AM, AI) are considered. It is shown that in the S/FI
and S/AI heterostructures the the proximity effect creates a well-defined spin
splitting of the electronic spectra in the S layer. Thus, they are well
described by the effective model. At the same time, the proximity effect in
S/FM and S/AM heterostructures also creates a spin splitting of the spectra of
the S layer, but it has a chaotic spectral and spatial distribution and
unpredictable amplitude and, in general, cannot be detected via the spin
splitting of the superconducting density of states. Thus, the effective model
is not applicable to such heterostructures. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that
they support well-pronounced triplet correlations and, thus, can be used for
spintronics applications.

Abstract: Determining crystal structures from X-ray diffraction data is fundamental
across diverse scientific fields, yet remains a significant challenge when data
is limited to low resolution. While recent deep learning models have made
breakthroughs in solving the crystallographic phase problem, the resulting
low-resolution electron density maps are often ambiguous and difficult to
interpret. To overcome this critical bottleneck, we introduce XDXD, to our
knowledge, the first end-to-end deep learning framework to determine a complete
atomic model directly from low-resolution single-crystal X-ray diffraction
data. Our diffusion-based generative model bypasses the need for manual map
interpretation, producing chemically plausible crystal structures conditioned
on the diffraction pattern. We demonstrate that XDXD achieves a 70.4\% match
rate for structures with data limited to 2.0~\AA{} resolution, with a
root-mean-square error (RMSE) below 0.05. Evaluated on a benchmark of 24,000
experimental structures, our model proves to be robust and accurate.
Furthermore, a case study on small peptides highlights the model's potential
for extension to more complex systems, paving the way for automated structure
solution in previously intractable cases.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The special quasirandom structure (SQS) method is a widely used approach for
modeling random alloys with periodic boundary conditions. Among available
implementations, the Alloy Theoretic Automated Toolkit (ATAT) mcsqs module
remains one of the most established tools for SQS generation. However, its
command-line operation and input file preparation often present a steep
learning curve, particularly for students and researchers without programming
experience. To lower these barriers, we have developed SimplySQS
(simplysqs.com), an online, browser-based interactive interface that automates
the preparation, execution, and analysis of ATAT mcsqs outputs. SimplySQS
allows users to upload or import structures from databases (MP, AFLOW, COD),
configure compositions and supercells via guided forms, automatically generate
ATAT input and batch scripts, and visualize results such as convergence
behavior, correlation functions, and radial distribution functions. The best
SQS outputs can be exported in standard formats (POSCAR, CIF, LMP, XYZ). By
simplifying setup and minimizing file-handling errors, SimplySQS broadens
access to ATAT mcsqs, making SQS generation more approachable for beginners
while streamlining workflows for experienced users. The workflow is illustrated
on the perovskite series Pb1-xSrxTiO3 (PSTO, including PbTiO3 (PTO) and SrTiO3
(STO)), where an all-in-one batch script generated with SimplySQS was used to
obtain SQSs across the composition range. The resulting structures were
subsequently optimized using the MACE MATPES-r2SCAN-0 universal
machine-learning interatomic potential (MLIP) to predict evolution of lattice
parameters. The MLIP accurately reproduced the cubic-to-tetragonal transition
near x = 0.5, with lattice parameters deviating by less than 1 % in the cubic
(x > 0.5) and 3 % in the tetragonal (x < 0.5) regions.

Abstract: We present an automated benchmarking suite for face-centered-cubic (FCC)
nickel that evaluates 47 quantitative metrics spanning both standard tests
(equation of state, elastic constants, surface energies and phonons) and
application-specific scenarios such as defect formation and migration, grain
boundaries, step edges, close-range interactions, and vacancy cluster
energetics. Using this framework, we assess 34 interatomic potentials from the
OpenKIM repository, including pairwise, embedded-atom, modified-embedded-atom,
angular-dependent, and spectral neighbor analysis potentials (SNAP). Results
are compared against ab initio benchmarks compiled from the literature. Most
potentials accurately reproduce lattice parameters, elastic constants, and
surface energies, whereas predictive accuracy degrades for migration barriers
and short-range compression. Principal-component analysis identifies correlated
property groups and a partially orthogonal component associated with migration
and short-range physics, revealing Pareto trade-offs between accuracy domains.
SNAP models occupy the lowest-error frontier, although several embedded-atom
potentials remain competitive across many metrics. The framework provides a
reproducible baseline for potential selection, highlights systematic
limitations across formalisms, and supports benchmarking-in-the-loop strategies
for developing next-generation machine-learning potentials for Ni and Ni-based
alloys.

Abstract: Magnetite is an important mineral with many interesting applications related
to its magnetic, electrical and thermal properties. Typically studied by
electronic structure calculations, these methods are unable to capture the
complex ion dynamics at relevant temperatures, time and length scales. We
present a hybrid Monte Carlo/Molecular Dynamics (MC/MD) method based on iron
oxidation state exchange for accurate atomistic modelling of bulk magnetite,
magnetite surfaces and nanoparticles that captures the complex ionic dynamics.
By comparing oxidation state patterns with those obtained from density
functional theory, we confirmed the accuracy of our approach. Lattice
distortions leading to the stabilisation of excess charges and a critical
surface thickness at which the oxidation states transition from ordered to
disordered were observed. This simple yet efficient approach paves the way for
elucidating aspects of oxidation state ordering of inverse spinel structures in
general and battery materials in particular.

Abstract: Improving energy efficiency by recovering waste heat and providing thermal
protection is of high technological importance. This work investigates the
chalcogenide compounds CdGa2Te4 and ZnGa2Te4 using density functional theory
and BoltzTraP2 calculations. Both materials are dynamically stable, brittle,
and elastically anisotropic. Electronic structure calculations show direct band
gaps that range from 1.0 to 2.2 electronvolt. Carrier effective masses are
favorable, with CdGa2Te4 showing light electrons equal to 0.21 times the free
electron mass and ZnGa2Te4 showing moderately heavy carriers equal to 0.39
times the free electron mass. Thermoelectric transport calculations yield large
Seebeck coefficients of about 108 to 119 microvolt per kelvin. The
thermoelectric figure of merit ZT increases from about 0.4 at 50 K to about
0.78 at 800 kelvin, indicating promising thermoelectric performance. For
thermal barrier coating applications, both compounds combine ultralow lattice
thermal conductivity with moderate melting points around 790 to 850 K and small
thermal expansion coefficients, which helps resist thermal stress. Overall,
CdGa2Te4 and ZnGa2Te4 are multifunctional materials suitable for efficient
waste heat recovery and durable thermal barrier operation below 900 K.

Abstract: A first principles study is conducted to explore the changes in the magnetic
structure of Mn\textsubscript{3}GaN under anisotropic biaxial strain.
Mn\textsubscript{3}GaN is an antiperovskite with a structure similar to that of
an ideal cubic perovskite. Several manganese nitride antiperovskites including
Mn\textsubscript{3}GaN were reported to have a frustrated noncollinear
antiferromagnetic structure. Successful electric switching of its magnetic
structure has been reported. Furthermore, despite a cubic lattice symmetry, the
magnetic symmetry is rhombohedral, allowing a piezomagnetic response. Tensile
biaxial strain has been shown to produce a net magnetic moment by inducing
in-plane spin canting. Compressive biaxial strain has been used to induce a
spin-polarized ferro- or ferrimagnetic phase. In this study, anisotropic strain
in the (001) plane is applied, outlining a magnetic phase diagram that can
predict the properties when growing Mn\textsubscript{3}GaN thin films on
noncubic substrates. The lattice vectors along the a and b crystallographic
axes are strained by -5\% to 5\% in percentwise increments in all permutations.
An extensive phase diagram is mapped, revealing multiple combinations of strain
applied to the two lattice vectors that result in a ferro- or ferrimagnetic
transition. Unlike previous results, not only strictly compressive strain on
both lattice vectors, but combinations of tensile and compressive strain, as
well as uniaxial strain, are seen producing the magnetic phase transitions.
Furthermore, while biquadratic strain was seen producing a net moment in the
[110] direction under tensile strain and [\bar{1}\bar{1}0] under compressive
strain, anisotropic strain allows tuning the direction of the net
magnetization.

Abstract: Recent developments in materials informatics and artificial intelligence has
led to the emergence of foundational energy models for material chemistry, as
represented by the suite of MACE-based foundation models, bringing a
significant breakthrough in universal potentials for inorganic solids. As to
all method developments in computational materials science, performance
benchmarking against existing high-level data with focusing on specific
applications, is critically needed to understand the limitations in the models,
thus facilitating the ongoing improvements in the model development process,
and occasionally, leading to significant conceptual leaps in materials theory.
Here, using our own published DFT (Density Functional Theory) database of
room-temperature dynamic stability and vibrational anharmonicity for $\sim2000$
cubic halide double perovskites, we benchmarked the performances of four
different variants of the MACE foundation models for screening the dynamic
stabilities of inorganic solids. Our analysis shows that, as anticipated, the
model accuracy improves with more training data. The dynamic stabilities of
weakly anharmonic materials (as predicted by DFT) are more accurately
reproduced by the foundation model, than those highly anharmonic and
dynamically unstable ones. The predominant source of error in predicting the
dynamic stability arises predominantly from the amplification of errors in
atomic forces when predicting the harmonic phonon properties through the
computation of the Hessian matrix, less so is the contribution from possible
differences in the range of the configurational spaces that are sampled by DFT
and the foundation model in molecular dynamics. We hope that our present
findings will stimulate future works towards more physics-inspired approaches
in assessing the accuracy of foundation models for atomistic modelling.

Abstract: We introduce a force following active learning algorithm that integrates
density functional theory DFT with the Gaussian Approximation Potential GAP
framework to develop a robust interatomic potential IP for a dislocation in a
topological insulator Bi1xSbx. Starting from an initial potential IP0 trained
on unit cell data from strained Bi Sb binaries our active learning approach
iteratively refines the IP during a structural relaxation. In each cycle if the
force error uncertainty of any atom near the dislocation core exceeds a
threshold value the IPi is efficiently retrained IPi to IPi1 by incorporating
DFT computed forces and energies of atoms near the high uncertainty atom. This
strategy ensures that the relaxation process maintains a low force error until
full convergence is achieved. Consequently the final IP here IP5 has two
capabilities 1 it reproduces the relaxation pathway observed during the active
learning process unlike the initial IP0 which lacks prior dislocation core
knowledge and 2 it captures the lattice and elastic properties of Bi Sb
binaries across a range of Sb concentrations. We also evaluate dislocation
properties Peierls stresses and dislocation generation by compression to assess
the performance of the trained potential IP5.

Abstract: Alloying by addition of oxygen interstitials during additive manufacturing
provides new routes to strengthen and toughen metals and alloys. The underlying
mechanisms by which such interstitial atoms lead to enhanced properties remain,
however, unclear, not least due a lack of quantitative atomic-scale models
linking microstructure to properties. Here using quasi-3D imaging based on
multi-slice electron ptychography, we reveal the importance of a new type of
interstitial-character lattice defect, namely zero-dimensional stacking domains
(ZDSDs), present in high density in AM-processed oxygen-modulated pure
titanium. These ZDSDs promote slip diversity, and support intense work
hardening, enabling a three-fold enhancement in both strength and ductility in
Ti-0.45O compared to conventional pure Ti. The work demonstrates the potential
for using interstitial solutes to enhance mechanical properties in a range of
critical engineering alloys.

Abstract: Floquet engineering has emerged as a powerful approach for dynamically
tailoring the electronic structures of quantum materials through time-periodic
light fields generated by ultrafast laser pulses. The light fields can
transiently dress Bloch electrons, creating novel electronic states
inaccessible in equilibrium. While such temporal modulation provides dynamic
control, spatially periodic modulations, such as those arising from charge
density wave (CDW) order, can also dramatically reconstruct the band structure
through real-space symmetry breaking. The interplay between these two distinct
forms of modulation-temporal and spatial-opens a new frontier in
electronic-phase-dependent Floquet engineering. Here we demonstrate this
concept experimentally in the prototypical CDW material 1T-TiSe$_2$. Using
time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (TrARPES) with mid-infrared
pumping, we observe a striking pump-induced instantaneous downshift of the
valence band maximum (VBM), which is in sharp contrast to the subsequent upward
shift on picosecond timescale associated with CDW melting. Most remarkably, the
light-induced VBM downshift is observed exclusively in the CDW phase and only
when the pump pulse is present, reaching maximum when pumping near resonance
with the CDW gap. These observations unequivocally reveal the critical role of
CDW in the Floquet engineering of TiSe$_2$. Our work demonstrates how
time-periodic drives can synergistically couple to spatially periodic
modulations to create non-equilibrium electronic states, establishing a new
paradigm for Floquet engineering enabled by spontaneous symmetry breaking.

successfully predicts activation energies and Arrhenius prefactors with high
accuracy ($R^2=0.804$ and $R^2=0.723$, respectively) and reveals clear physical
trends linking ionic transport (particularly activation energy) to coordination
environment, elastic moduli, and lattice flexibility. GoodRegressor bridges
data-driven prediction and physical understanding, providing a transparent and
extensible platform for symbolic regression applicable across diverse materials

Abstract: The Cu-deficient CuxInSe2 (x larger than 0.3) phase can be stabilized as a
thin film. A uniform Cu-deficient composition with a chalcopyrite structure was
obtained by the precision engineering of a two-step synthesis process involving
electron-beam evaporation and Se vapor deposition. Detailed structural and
chemical analyses were performed employing various X-ray and microscopic
techniques to demonstrate that the chemical states and local structure in the
Cu-Se-In tetrahedral networks change with the loss of Cu, the In-Se bond
becomes shorter, and the In ions become excessively oxidized without phase
separation. Moreover, the results indicate that the bandgap narrowing is
primarily attributed to the reconstruction of In3+d 5s orbital states. The
bandgap narrows from 1.51 eV to 1.4 eV, which is optimal for the photon
absorber. Therefore, cation-deficient selenide is promising for stable nontoxic
photovoltaics with tunable bandgaps.

Abstract: Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have had a profound impact on numerous
emerging optoelectronic technologies, achieving performance metrics that rival
or exceed incumbent materials. This impact is underpinned by the exceptional
properties of MHPs, including tuneable band gaps, high absorption coefficients,
long carrier diffusion lengths and combined with uncomplicated synthesis
methods. However, current MHP production relies on the toxic solvents, which
pose significant environmental and health risks. Moreover, these methods often
require complex multi component solvent systems and thermal processing to
achieve the desired material phases, further hindering scalability and
sustainability. Overcoming these challenges is critical to the future
development of MHP-based technologies. Overcoming these challenges is critical
to the future development of MHP-based technologies. Here, we present a novel
water-based solvent system and synthetic approach for the preparation of
size-controlled CsPbBr3 perovskite nanocrystals in ambient air and at room
temperature. The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of CsPbBr3 erovskite
nanocrystals (PNCs) exceeds 60 precent. To demonstrate the light to current
conversion ability of our PNCs a series of photoconductors were prepared, with
the best performing devices achieving a specific detectivity (D*) of 1.2 x
10^11 Jones. Thus, this green, scalable, and low-cost approach offers a
sustainable pathway for precise size and compositional control of MHP
nanocrystals, opening new possibilities for environmentally friendly

Abstract: Sesqui-chalcogenides serve as a critical bridge between traditional
semiconductors and quantum materials, offering significant potential in
applications such as thermoelectrics, phase change memory, and topological
insulators. While considerable attention has been focused on antimony- and
bismuth-based compounds, characterized by substantial property changes upon
reduction in film thickness, indium containing sesqui-chalcogenides like
In$_2$Te$_3$ are emerging as promising candidates for photovoltaics and
electronic devices. However, the effects of film thickness on the properties of
In$_2$Te$_3$ remain largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate
high-quality In$_2$Te$_3$ thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy on Si(111)
substrates across a thickness range from 2.7 nm to 24 nm. We employ X-ray
diffraction, reflective high-energy electron diffraction and atomic force
microscopy to analyze both the crystal structure and film morphology.
Additionally, we utilize broadband optical spectroscopy alongside femtosecond
pump-probe measurements and Raman spectroscopy to assess optical and
vibrational properties, respectively. Our analysis reveals that material
properties exhibit minimal dependence on film thickness, contrasting sharply
with behavior observed in other chalcogenides such as Sb$_2$Te$_3$,
Bi$_2$Se$_3$, or GeTe. This phenomenon can be attributed to covalent bonding
present in In$_2$Te$_3$, which differs from those in its antimony- and
bismuth-containing counterparts.

Abstract: Defects in two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors play a decisive role in
determining their electronic, optical, catalytic and quantum properties.
Understanding how defect energy levels respond to variations in layer thickness
is essential for achieving reproducible and scalable device performance. We
report the persistence of layer-tolerant defect levels in rhenium disulfide
(ReS2), where both donor- and acceptor-type charge transition levels remain
nearly unchanged from monolayer to bulk in both AA and AB stacking. The
associated two-level quantum system also retains its character across
thicknesses, enabling ReS2 to serve as a platform for layer-tolerant
single-photon emitters. The invariance arises from the interplay between
electronic energy minimization and structural relaxation, which together
counteract quantum confinement and reduced dielectric screening. Additionally,
the intrinsically weak interlayer coupling in ReS2 plays a crucial role. Our
findings uncover the microscopic origin of this unique behavior, distinguishing
ReS2 from other transitionmetal dichalcogenides and highlighting its potential
for thickness-independent optoelectronic and quantum photonic applications.

Abstract: We employ interpretable explicit machine learning to analyze the material
dependence of the magnetic transition temperature $T_c$ in ferromagnetic and
ferrimagnetic Heusler compounds. For around 200 compounds, we consider both
experimental $T_c$ and calculated $T_c$ using \textit{ab initio} determination
of magnetic interactions together with a Monte-Carlo solution. We use the
hierarchical dependence extraction (HDE) procedure [Mor\'ee and Arita, Phys.
Rev. B 110, 014502 (2024)] to extract the dependencies of $T_c$ on chemical
proportions and magnetic moments from the main order to the higher order, and
construct an explicit expression of $T_c$ from these dependencies. The main
results are: (a) $T_c$ is mainly controlled by the proportions of Fe, Co, and
Mn, and increases with these proportions, consistent with previous machine
learning analyses of ferromagnetic materials. (b) The HDE describes $T_c$ with
an accuracy that is comparable to that of other machine learning procedures.
(c) The HDE expression of $T_c$ can be interpreted as a generalized order
parameter that increases with increasing magnetization amplitude, in
qualitative agreement with various theories of phase transitions. These results
strengthen our understanding of the material dependence of $T_c$ in collinear
Heusler magnets and motivate the further use of HDE in material design.

Abstract: The toxicity and stability issues of lead-based perovskites motivate the
search for non-toxic, durable alternatives. This work examines lead-free
$\mathrm{Mg_3ZBr_3}$ ($Z=\mathrm{As,Sb,Bi}$) halide perovskites as
optoelectronic materials, with emphasis on $\mathrm{Mg_3AsBr_3}$ and
$\mathrm{Mg_3SbBr_3}$. First-principles calculations establish cubic
$Pm\bar{3}m$ frameworks stabilized by strong Mg--Br linkages, and indirect band
gaps of $2.0645\,\mathrm{eV}$ for $\mathrm{Mg_3AsBr_3}$ and
$1.6533\,\mathrm{eV}$ for $\mathrm{Mg_3SbBr_3}$ obtained using hybrid
functionals. Optical spectra show a rapid rise in absorption above the gap and
an increasing static dielectric response along
$\mathrm{As}\rightarrow\mathrm{Sb}\rightarrow\mathrm{Bi}$, indicating
strengthened light--matter coupling. Phonon dispersions lack imaginary
branches, confirming dynamical stability, and exhibit large mode anharmonicity
(Gr\"uneisen signatures) consistent with soft-lattice heat transport. Moving
down the pnictogen series expands the lattice and lowers the Goldschmidt
tolerance factor, while enhanced pnictogen--Br $p$-orbital hybridization and
stereochemically active $n\mathrm{s}^{2}$ lone pairs (Sb, Bi) narrow the band
gap and increase the optical dielectric response. Elastic analyses confirm Born
stability and moderate stiffness, with Hill-averaged bulk moduli decreasing
from approximately $44\,\mathrm{GPa}$ ($\mathrm{Mg_3AsBr_3}$) to
$35\,\mathrm{GPa}$ ($\mathrm{Mg_3BiBr_3}$). Drift--diffusion $p$--$i$--$n$
simulations qualitatively track band-edge-limited spectra, aligning with the
computed gaps. Together, these results position these materials as promising
lead-free candidates for stable thin-film photodiode and photovoltaic
applications.

Abstract: Multiferroics are materials with coexisting electric and magnetic orders that
are of central importance for fundamental research and applications in sensor
and information technologies. However, intrinsic multiferroics that operate at
room temperature remain rare due to an apparent incompatibility between
magnetism and ferroelectricity. Here we predict that a pure ferroelectric hosts
multiferroic-like quasiparticles that simultaneously carry \emph{static}
magnetic and electric dipoles. The electric dipole moment emerges from the
parity-odd anharmonicity of the ferroelectric dynamics, while the magnetic
moment has both paramagnetic and diamagnetic origins generated by circularly
polarized transverse fluctuations of the ferroelectric polarization. In
contrast to the established ``dynamical multiferroicity" of conventional
phonons, which involve only \emph{oscillating} electric dipoles, these
``multiferron" modes produce a colossal electric-field-tunable second-harmonic
optical response as well as a magnetoelectric cross coupling. Multiferrons open
a new route toward nonlinear THz optical applications and offer multiferroic
functionalities in simple ferroelectrics.

Abstract: The brownmillerite-type oxide Ba$_2$In$_2$O$_5$ (BIO) is a potential
candidate as an electrolyte material for mixed ionic-electronic conduction in
solid oxide fuel cells. Despite its structural relation to perovskite oxides,
the defect chemistry of BIO has remained largely unexplored. Using Density
Functional Theory within the generalized gradient approximation, complemented
by selected hybrid-functional calculations, we evaluate the formation energies,
charge transition levels, and concentrations as a function of oxygen partial
pressure of vacancies, oxygen interstitials, Frenkel pairs, and substitutional
Cr doping. Our results reveal that oxygen vacancies and interstitials dominate
the intrinsic defect landscape. Among the interstitials, we identify stable
dumbbell configurations that remain neutral across the entire band gap. Other
interstitial configurations show charged states and become the prevailing
compensating defect at high oxygen partial pressures. For extrinsic doping, we
find that Cr preferentially substitutes at the tetrahedral In site and behaves
as a donor. Its negative formation energies suggest the formation of secondary
phases, possibly the tetragonal Cr-doped BIO. These results provide a first
picture of the thermodynamics of intrinsic and extrinsic defects in BIO and set
the stage for future investigations into the tetragonal phase and the diffusion
dynamics of oxygen vacancies and interstitials.

(DOS) indicates significant contributions from O $2p$, Sb $5p$, and Pr $5d$
orbitals. Optical property calculations, including the dielectric function and
absorption coefficient, reveal strong absorption in the UV regions, making
$\mathrm{Sr_2PrSbO_6}$ a promising candidate for optoelectronic applications
such as UV light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and photovoltaic-thermoelectric (PV-TE)
tandem systems. At room temperature, the calculated dimensionless quantity $ZT$
is $0.33$, which indicates this material as a possible candidate for
thermoelectric applications. Our results will serve as a benchmark for future
experimental and theoretical research on the properties of this material.

Abstract: Donor doping as a form of point defect engineering is a popular strategy for
tuning the physical properties of functional oxides. The renewed interest in
dislocation-tuned functional properties in ceramics requires a deeper
understanding of point defect-dislocation interactions. Here, we study the
room-temperature dislocation plasticity of donor-doped (0.05 wt% and 0.5 wt% Nb
as dopants) single-crystal SrTiO3 across the length scale, using a
combinatorial mechanical deformation approach including nanoindentation
(nano-/microscale), Brinell indentation (mesoscale), and uniaxial bulk
compression (macroscale). Compared to the nominally undoped sample, Nb-doped
SrTiO3 exhibits higher nanoindentation pop-in load and lower indentation creep
rates, suggesting less favored dislocation nucleation and motion. Under cyclic
Brinell indentation, the discrete slip traces on the 0.5 wt% Nb-doped sample
indicate suppressed dislocation multiplication. Extending to bulk compression,
0.5 wt% Nb-doped samples exhibit ~50% higher yield strength compared to that of
the nominally undoped sample. We further validated the findings by comparing
with an acceptor (Fe)-doped single crystal with equivalent doping
concentrations. This length-scale bridging approach consistently reveals
suppressed dislocation nucleation, multiplication, and motion in the 0.5 wt%
Nb-doped samples. These insights underline the importance of dislocation-defect
chemistry on the mechanical behavior of functional oxides.

Abstract: Argyrodite solid electrolytes, such as Li$_6$PS$_5$Cl, exhibit some of the
highest known superionic conductivities. Yet, the mechanistic understanding of
Li$^+$ transport in realistic argyrodite microstructures -- where atomic-scale
mechanisms interplay with continuum-scale dynamics at grain boundaries --
remains limited. Here, we resolve Li$^+$ transport in silico by developing
accurate machine-learning potentials via closed-loop active learning and
embedding the potentials in a multiscale modeling framework that integrates
molecular dynamics with finite element simulations. We show that bulk diffusion
barriers scale linearly with anion radius. Grain boundaries have opposite
effects depending on the bulk -- enhancing Li$^+$ diffusion in low-diffusivity
phases but suppressing it in fast-diffusing ones. Simulations of
polycrystalline Li$_6$PS$_5$I reveal non-Arrhenius transport behaviors
consistent with experiments. Grain-size-dependent predictions indicate that
grain refinement improves intergranular contacts in argyrodites without
compromising superionic conductivity, while nanosizing can activate ionic
transport in electrolytes lacking intrinsic superionic behavior. Our findings
highlight the decisive role of microstructure in developing solid electrolytes.

Abstract: Charge carriers in organic semiconductors form polarons, which are
self-localized states stabilized by interactions with their environment. Using
a dielectric-stabilized tight-binding model parameterized from first-principles
calculations, we compute ground and excited polaron states in
poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT). Our results quantitatively reproduce key
mid-infrared absorption features, notably the chain-length-dependent shift of
the intrachain polaron excitation peak (peak B) and its variation between
regioregular and regiorandom P3HT. Comparison to an alternative stabilization
mechanism based on local ring distortions reveals that dielectric polarization
dominates polaron formation, as ring distortions yield insufficient binding and
excitation energies inconsistent with experiments. These findings clarify the
microscopic origin of polarons in conjugated polymers and provide a predictive
framework linking polaron energetics to spectroscopic observables, advancing
the understanding of charge transport in organic semiconductors.

Abstract: Computational models are used here for simulating diffusion-controlled
redistribution of hydrogen that is picked up by zirconium-base nuclear fuel
cladding during light water reactor operation. Axial localization of hydrogen,
leading to localized precipitation of zirconium hydrides at lower-temperature
regions near interpellet gaps, is studied with a bespoke model, while radial
diffusion, leading to formation of a densely hydrided rim subjacent to the
waterside oxide layer, is studied with a more general model. The calculated
results are compared with experimental observations and similar computational
studies reported in the literature. The results underline the importance of
hydrogen redistribution with regard to local embrittlement of the cladding
tubes.

Abstract: The hexagonal multiferroic oxide YMnO$_3$ has demonstrated applications in
various fields and is widely researched due to its interesting properties.
Since Mn(3d)--O(2p) interactions predominate close to the Fermi level, doping
in the B-site (Mn) with Fe provides a way to modulate the band gap and magnetic
order of YMnO$_3$. The need for a lead-free ferroelectric material with a
narrow band gap is crucial for absorbing a wide range of the solar spectrum.
Density functional theory calculations were carried out using GGA and meta-GGA
(for an accurate description of the band gap) exchange correlation functional
for the Fe-doped YMnO$_3$ multiferroics. Various magnetic configurations were
analyzed, finding collinear G-type AFM as the least energy state. The hexagonal
lattice is retained after Fe doping with slight distortions and a change in
lattice constants. Fe doping reduces spin frustration and induces
magnetization, while reducing the band gap from 1.88 eV for pure to 1.19 eV for
a 25 percent doping concentration. Additionally, Fe doping exhibits an enhanced
dielectric response, characterized by an increase in the static dielectric
constant and the presence of strong absorption peaks in the visible and UV
energy ranges. Thermoelectric studies illustrate enhanced conductivity due to
increased charge carriers induced by doping. In summary, first-principles
predictions of structural, electronic, optical, and transport behavior in
Fe-doped YMnO$_3$ provide a foundation for tailoring this oxide in
photovoltaic, thermoelectric, and optoelectronic applications.

Abstract: Dislocations in ceramics have gained renewed research interest contrasting
the traditional belief that ceramics are brittle. Understanding dislocation
mechanics in representative oxides is beneficial for effective dislocation
engineering. Here, we use MgO single crystals with mechanically seeded
dislocation densities from ~10^12 to ~10^15 m-2 to investigate the mechanical
behavior such as yield and fracture. Nano-/micro-pillar compression tests
reveal a dislocation density-dependent yield strength, mediated by the varying
dominating dislocation mechanisms from nucleation to multiplication/motion. The
dislocation-seeded samples can achieve a much-improved compressive plastic
strain beyond ~70%, with a high yield strength of ~2.35 GPa (diameter of ~400
nm). Complementary bulk compression tests, along with digital image correlation
(DIC), demonstrate a consistent dislocation-mediated deformation and a notable
size effect, with bulk samples exhibiting much reduced yield strength (~120
MPa) compared to the nano-/micro-pillars. Using three-dimensional Discrete
Dislocation Dynamics (3D-DDD) simulation, we further underline the dislocation
avalanche and work hardening during compression. This study provides new
insights into dislocation-mediated plasticity in MgO across the length scale
with tunable dislocation densities.

Abstract: Traditional machine learning has advanced polymer discovery, yet direct
generation of chemically valid and synthesizable polymers without exhaustive
enumeration remains a challenge. Here we present polyT5, an encoder-decoder
chemical language model based on the T5 architecture, trained to understand and
generate polymer structures. polyT5 enables both property prediction and the
targeted generation of polymers conditioned on desired property values. We
demonstrate its utility for dielectric polymer design, seeking candidates with
dielectric constant >3, bandgap >4 eV, and glass transition temperature >400 K,
alongside melt-processability and solubility requirements. From over 20,000
generated promising candidates, one was experimentally synthesized and
validated, showing strong agreement with predictions. To further enhance
usability, we integrated polyT5 within an agentic AI framework that couples it
with a general-purpose LLM, allowing natural language interaction for property
prediction and generative design. Together, these advances establish a
versatile and accessible framework for accelerated polymer discovery.
