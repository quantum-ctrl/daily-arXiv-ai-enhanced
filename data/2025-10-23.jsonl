Using the quasiclassical Eilenberger formalism, we\nsystematically investigate both the bulk SDE and the JDE in a clean NCS with\nRashba SOC and in-plane magnetic fields. For the bulk system, we find that the\ndiode efficiency can nominally approach its maximal value at the critical\nendpoint of the first-order Lifshitz transition between weak and strong helical\nphases featuring finite-momentum Cooper pairs, the latter marked by the\nemergence of Bogolyubov Fermi surfaces (BFSs). In a Josephson junction, we show\nthat finite-momentum pairing in the superconducting leads is the dominant\nmechanism behind the JDE in short junctions, whereas in long junctions it is\nprimarily governed by the Zeeman field in the normal region. In the\nlong-junction regime, the diode efficiency additionally oscillates between\npositive and negative values as a function of magnetic field at low fields,\nproviding a route toward a highly tunable Josephson diode. At higher fields,\nthe onset of BFSs in the strong helical phase leads to a sharp suppression of\nboth the JDE and the Josephson current when the current direction is aligned\nwith momenta along the BFS, resulting in strong anisotropy. We propose that\nthis anisotropy in the Josephson current offers an alternative method for\ndetecting BFSs, applicable to systems with or without a JDE."}
