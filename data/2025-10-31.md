Abstract: Superconducting diode effects (SDE), both in bulk superconductors and in
Josephson junctions, have garnered a lot of attention due to potential
applications in classical and quantum computing, as well as superconducting
sensors. Here we review various mechanisms that have been theoretically
proposed for their realization. We first provide a brief historical overview
and discuss the basic but subtle phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau theory of
SDE, emphasizing the need to the simultaneous breaking of time-reversal and
inversion symmetries. We then proceed to more microscopic treatments, focusing
especially on implementations in noncentrosymmetric materials described by the
Rashba-Zeeman model. Finally, we review proposals based on other condensed
matter systems such as altermagnets, valley polarized and topological
materials, and systems out of equilibrium.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Superconductivity in compressed H3S arises from the interplay between
high-frequency phonons and a pronounced van Hove singularity near the Fermi
level. Using first-principles calculations, we investigate the superconducting
properties of H3S and D3S at 160 and 200 GPa, explicitly incorporating
anharmonic lattice dynamics and first-order vertex corrections to
electron-phonon (e-ph) interactions, thereby going beyond the Migdal
approximation underlying conventional Migdal-Eliashberg theory. We find that
both anharmonicity and nonadiabatic vertex corrections suppress the effective
e-ph coupling and reduce the superconducting critical temperature (Tc).
Calculations performed within the energy-dependent full-bandwidth Eliashberg
formalism, including both anharmonic and vertex effects, yield Tc values in
close agreement with experimental measurements for D3S at both pressures and
for H3S at 200 GPa.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The last two decades have witnessed a tremendous number of computational
predictions of hydride-based (phonon-mediated) superconductors, mostly at
extremely high pressures, i.e., hundreds of GPa. These discoveries were heavily
driven by Migdal-\'{E}liashberg theory (and its first-principles computational
implementations) for electron-phonon interactions, the key concept of
phonon-mediated superconductivity. Dozens of predictions were experimentally
synthesized and characterized, triggering not only enormous excitement in the
community but also some debates. In this Article, we review the
computational-driven discoveries and the recent developments in the field from
various essential aspects, including the theoretical, computational, and,
specifically, artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) based
approaches emerging within the paradigm of materials informatics. While
challenges and critical gaps can be found in all of these approaches, AI/ML
efforts specifically remain in its infant stage for good reasons. However,
opportunities exist when these approaches can be further developed and
integrated in concerted efforts, in which AI/ML approaches could play more
important roles.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: \beta-PdBi2 is one of the candidates for topological superconductors with a
superconducting (SC) transition temperature (Tc) of 5.3 K, in which parity
mixing of spin singlet and spin triplet has been anticipated, being crucial for
the further understanding of relationship with inversion symmetry and parity
mixing in the superconductivity. In this work, we measured the SC gap in
high-quality single crystal of \beta-PdBi2 by using high-resolution laser
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy below Tc. We found the isotropic SC
gaps in momentum space for multiple bands, and observed that the difference
between the SC gap of the topological surface bands and the bulk bands is about
0.1 meV, consistent with other experimental results. These direct and
quantitative experimental results support the possibility of \beta-PdBi2 as a
topological superconductor, characterized by unique crystal and electronic band
structures.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We investigate the Josephson effect in a two-dimensional superconducting
system with a smoothly and periodically varying order parameter. The order
parameter is modulated along one direction while remaining uniform in the
perpendicular direction, leading to a spatially periodic superconducting phase.
We show that the periodicity of the order parameter determines the winding
number of the eigenfunctions, which serves as a topological characterization of
the system. The winding number is calculated analytically and visualized
through the trajectory of the corresponding three-dimensional Bloch vector. By
solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation, we obtain both plane-wave solutions
describing bulk states and exponentially localized solutions that correspond to
edge modes. The analytic bulk-edge connection is employed to identify the
conditions under which the edge states emerge from the bulk spectrum. We find
that the winding numbers depend on the boundary conditions, which differ
between the plane-wave and exponential solutions. These results establish a
direct connection between the spatial modulation of the order parameter, the
topological structure of the eigenstates, and the emergence of edge modes in
periodically modulated Josephson systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We investigate $s$-wave superconductivity in negatively curved geometries,
focusing on Cayley trees and the hyperbolic plane. Using a self-consistent
Bogoliubov-de Gennes approach for trees and a BCS treatment of the hyperbolic
continuum, we establish a unified mean-field framework that captures the role
of boundaries in hyperbolic spaces. For finite Cayley trees with open
boundaries, the superconducting order parameter localizes at the edge while the
interior can remain normal, leading to two distinct critical temperatures:
$T_\textrm{c}^\textrm{edge} > T_\textrm{c}^\textrm{bulk}$. A corresponding
boundary-dominated phase also emerges in hyperbolic annuli and horodisc
regions, where radial variations of the local density of states enhance edge
pairing. We also demonstrate that the enhancement of the density of states at
the boundary is significantly more pronounced for the discrete tree geometry.
Our results show that, owing to the macroscopic extent of the boundary,
negative curvature can stabilize boundary superconductivity as a phase that
persists in the thermodynamic limit on par with the bulk superconductivity.
These results highlight fundamental differences between bulk and boundary
ordering in hyperbolic matter, and provide a theoretical framework for future
studies of correlated phases in negatively curved systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Charge-$4e$ superconductivity is an exotic state of matter that may emerge as
a vestigial order from a charge-$2e$ superconductor with multicomponent
superconducting order parameters. Showing its emergence in a microscopic model
from numerically-exact large-scale computations has been rare so far. Here, we
propose a microscopic lattice model with a nematic superconducting ground state
and show that it supports a rich set of vestigial phases at elevated
temperature, including a charge-$4e$ phase and a quasi-long-range nematic
phase, by performing large-scale Monte Carlo simulations. Combining theoretical
analysis with Monte Carlo simulations, we uncover the nature of these phases
and show that the phase transitions are governed by the proliferation of
distinct topological defects: half superconducting vortices,
$(\tfrac{1}{2},\tfrac{1}{2})$ vortices, integer nematic vortices, and
domain-wall excitations. In particular, we demonstrate that domain-wall
proliferation is crucial for the quasi-nematic phase and should be carefully
accounted for in phase transitions associated with vestigial charge-$4e$ order.

Abstract: Analog crossbar arrays consisting of emerging memory devices can greatly
alleviate the computational strain required by vector matrix multiplications
for neural network applications. The ability to produce spin orbit
torque-magnetic random-access memory (SOT-MRAM) at wafer-scale positions
SOT-MRAM as a strong memory candidate. In this work, we fabricate and measure
300 mm-compatible SOT-MRAM with 150% tunnel magnetoresistance ratio, fast (2
ns) and low voltage (<1 V) operation, low energy dissipation (350 fJ), low
write noise (0.1%), and low device-to-device variation of 10%. Through 2-bit
quantization aware training and noisy training as mitigation techniques, the
measured SOT-MRAM devices attain 95% on MNIST. The bi-stable anisotropy and
stochastic switching of SOT-MRAM can additionally be leveraged for stochastic
training of binary neural networks, able to reach ideal accuracy for a single
device. Lastly, the devices were evaluated on implementation of probabilistic
graph modeling and the interplay of tunnel magnetoresistance ratio, probability
curve distribution, and conductance noise was shown to reduce potential errors
in implementation. Through these results, SOT-MRAM is shown to be a uniquely
effective candidate for implementation of crossbar accelerators in memory- and
energy-limited applications, able to take advantage of stochastic operation and
bi-stability to beneficial results in neural network applications.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recent advances in the scaling of spin qubits have led to the development of
sparse architectures where spin qubits are distributed across multiple quantum
dots. This distributed approach enables qubit manipulation through hopping and
flopping modes, as well as protocols for spin shuttling to entangle spins
beyond nearest neighbors. Therefore, understanding spin tunneling across
quantum dots is fundamental for the improvement of sparse array encodings.
Here, we develop a microscopic theory of a minimal sparse array formed by a
hole in a double quantum dot. We show the existence of spin-dependent magnetic
corrections to the tunnel couplings that help preserve existing sweet spots,
even for quantum dots with different $g$-factors, and introduce new ones that
are not accounted for in the simplest models. Our analytical and numerical
results explain observed sweet spots in state-of-the-art shuttling and cQED
experiments, are relevant to hopping and flopping modes, and apply broadly to
sparse array encodings of any size.

Abstract: Parametric excitation in coupled mechanical systems has enabled advances in
sensing, computation, and phonon control. The function of distinct phase modes
using parametric driving remains insufficiently explored. Here, we investigate
the nonlinear and parametric response of degenerate phase modes in a Double
Ended Tuning Fork (DETF) resonator. Our measurements reveal pronounced
nonlinearity and parametric amplification in the out-phase mode, attributed to
the dominant contribution of the coupling beam, while the in-phase mode remains
predominantly linear. Uniquely, we demonstrate parametric excitation through
the coupling spring, enabling selective amplification and de-amplification
controlled via the relative phase between harmonic and parametric drives. A
parametric gain of $\sim$13 dB is achieved in the out-phase mode, with
phase-dependent modulation of amplification, indicating its suitability for
signal processing, logic operations, and memory elements based on degenerate
modes. These results establish a new approach to exploiting mode-specific
nonlinear dynamics in coupled resonators for emerging applications in sensing
and phononic control.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We use time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (TR-ARPES)
combined with density functional theory to investigate ultrafast carrier
dynamics in low-symmetry layered semiconducting PdSe$_2$. The indirect bandgap
is determined to be 0.55~eV. Following photoexcitation above this gap, we
resolve a valence band shift and broadening, both lasting less than a
picosecond, consistent with bandgap renormalization and carrier scattering,
indicative of strong many-body interactions. Subsequently, hot carriers
populate the conduction band minimum and are captured by defect states. A
surface photovoltage (SPV) of $\sim$ 67~meV emerges, persisting for over 50~ps,
driven by defect-assisted charge separation. The formation of native vacancies,
promoted by the low-symmetry lattice, likely gives rise to the mid-gap states
responsible for this long-lived SPV response. Detailed analysis of TR-ARPES
spectra disentangles the contributions of bandgap renormalization, carrier
scattering, defect states, and SPV. These findings establish PdSe$_2$ as a
prototypical layered quantum material exhibiting exotic photoresponses on
ultrafast timescales.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Conventional spin pumping, driven by magnetization dynamics, is longitudinal
since the pumped spin current flows normal to the interface between the
ferromagnet and the conductor. We predict \textit{Hall-type/transverse} and
\textit{unidirectional} spin pumping into conductors by near-field
electromagnetic radiation emitted by, \textit{e.g.}, magnetization dynamics.
The joint effect of the electric and magnetic fields results in a pure spin
current flowing parallel to the interface, i.e., a Hall-type spin pumping,
which is highly efficient due to the strong coupling to the electric field.
Such a transverse spin current is unidirectional, with the spatial distribution
controlled by the magnetization direction. Our finding reveals a robust
approach for generating and manipulating spin currents in future
low-dimensional spintronic and orbitronic devices.

Abstract: The bound electron-hole pairs known as excitons govern the optical properties
of insulating solids. While their behavior in equilibrium is well-understood
theoretically, the nonequilibrium regime at high excitation densities-where
phenomena like electron-hole liquids emerge - is less explored. This thesis
presents a first-principles study of excitons in two-dimensional materials. We
use the GW approximation and the Bethe-Salpeter equation to investigate their
properties from equilibrium to nonequilibrium conditions. We first demonstrate
how increasing photo-excited carrier density leads to a redshift-blueshift
crossover of excitons. We then show that electron-phonon interactions
critically modify optical spectra and exciton lifetimes at finite temperatures.
Finally, we unify these effects to demonstrate the formation of an
electron-hole liquid phase above a critical carrier density and below a
critical temperature. Our work identifies how enhanced Coulomb interactions in
two dimensions can stabilize this phase at significantly higher temperatures,
proposing promising material candidates for observing these collective states.

Abstract: Here we show the first experimental implementation of the fully general
Kitaev chain with complex-valued order parameter $\Delta$ and site-varying
synthetic chemical potential $\mu$, using a passive multilayer acoustic
resonator design and fabrication. Our laboratory model faithfully reproduces
the key symmetries and the topological phase diagram of the model, and displays
robust Majorana-like edge modes spatially localized at smoothly engineered
domain walls and energetically localized in the middle of the bulk spectral
gap. We demonstrate precise control over mode positioning through smooth
spatial variations of $\mu$, and validate the stability of the modes and of the
spectral gap under continuous and complex variations of $\Delta$ -- both
critical requirements for topological braiding operations. These results
establish and validate the fundamental building blocks for experimental
implementation of complete braiding protocols, opening concrete pathways toward
accessible non-abelian physics and topologically protected information
processing.

Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures allow the engineering of electronic and
magnetic properties by the stacking different two-dimensional vdW materials.
For example, orbital hybridisation and charge transfer at a vdW interface may
result in electric fields across the interface that give rise to Rashba
spin-orbit coupling. In magnetic vdW heterostructures, this in turn can drive
the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction which leads to a canting of local
magnetic moments at the vdW interface and may thus stabilise novel 2D magnetic
phases. While such emergent magnetic "interphases" offer a promising platform
for spin-based electronics, direct spectroscopic evidence for them is still
lacking. Here, we report Zeeman effects with Land\'e $g$-factors up to
$\approx230$ at the interface of graphene and the vdW ferromagnet
Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$. They arise from a magnetic interphase in which local-moment
canting and itinerant orbital moments generated by the non-trivial band
topology of Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ conspire to cause a giant asymmetric level splitting
when a magnetic field is applied. Exploiting the inelastic phonon gap of
graphene, we can directly access the buried vdW interface to the Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$
by scanning tunnelling spectroscopy. Systematically analyzing the Faraday-like
screening of the tip electric field by the graphene, we demonstrate the
tunability of the constitutional interface dipole, as well as the Zeeman
effect, by tip gating. Our findings are supported by density functional theory
and electrostatic modelling.

Abstract: The interaction between hydrogen atoms and carbon nanoparticles is a
fundamental process governing the properties of carbonaceous materials in
environments ranging from combustion systems to the interstellar medium. This
study investigates the effects of controlled atomic hydrogen exposure on young
and mature soot nanoparticles, generated in premixed ethylene-air flames, and
deposited on substrates. We employed a multi-technique approach to characterize
the chemical, mechanical, and electrical evolution of the films. In-situ
infrared spectroscopy revealed non-monotonic behavior: an initial increase in
aliphatic CH bonds was observed, followed by a decrease at higher hydrogen
fluences. This was accompanied by a continuous decrease in the aromatic C=C
signal. Atomic force microscopy showed a significant increase in the Young's
modulus of the film for both sample types after hydrogenation. This mechanical
change was correlated with an increase in the I(D)/I(G) ratio from Raman
spectroscopy. Furthermore, both macroscopic current vs. voltage and local
scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements demonstrated a notable increase in
electrical conductivity. For single just-formed soot particles, moreover, a
hydrogen-induced transformation from a semiconductive to a semi-metallic nature
was observed. The collective evidence points towards an H-induced CC
cross-linking mechanism within the nanoparticle films. We propose that atomic
hydrogen facilitates the formation of radical sites, which promotes covalent
bond formation between adjacent particles or molecular units, creating a more
interconnected and rigid network, with smaller interlayer distance. These
findings provide crucial insights into the structural evolution of carbonaceous
materials in hydrogen-rich environments, with direct implications for
understanding soot formation and for the tailored design of carbon-based
materials.

Abstract: Diamond and diamond-like carbon (DLC) coatings are widely employed for their
exceptional mechanical, thermal and chemical properties, but their industrial
application is often limited by weak adhesion to metallic substrates. In this
work, we employ a high-throughput ab initio approach to systematically
investigate the adhesion of diamond-metal interfaces, combining a set of
technologically relevant metals (Al, Ag, Au, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ir, Mg, Mo, Pt, Rh,
Ti, V, W, Zn) with the C(111), C(111)-2x1 (Pandey reconstructed), C(110),
C(100), that are most common in diamond and are representative of different
types of bonds present in DLC. Thanks to our automated and accurate
computational protocol for interface construction and characterization,
databases are populated and relevant trends are identified on the effect of
surface graphitization, ability to form carbides and metal reactivity on carbon
film adhesion and delamination strength. Beyond capturing trends, our workflow
yields predictive insights. Indeed, we found that adhesion energy scales with
the geometric mean of the constituent surface energies, providing a simple
descriptor for rapid screening; while comparing the work of separation with the
metal's cohesive energy anticipates the fracture location under tensile
loading. A novel method based on g(r) analysis is introduced to identify when
contact with a metal drives rehybridization of surface carbon from sp2 to sp3,
the structural signature of improved resistance to delamination. These
structural changes are mirrored by an electronic rearrangement at the
interface, quantified by a charge-accumulation descriptor that strongly
correlates with adhesion.

Abstract: We consider theoretically the possibility of coexisting ferroelectric and
metallic altermagnetic order, which has recently been predicted in insulating
and semiconducting systems via ab initio calculations. Solving
self-consistently a mean-field Hubbard model, accounting also for the energy
cost of distorting the lattice to produce an electric polarization, our results
show that metallic altermagnetism and ferroelectricity suppress or enhance each
other depending on the doping level of the system. Close to half-filling, the
system can lower its energy by becoming altermagnetic, but at the expense of
losing the electric polarization. Away from half-filling, the coexistence of
ferroelectricity and altermagnetism is much more robust toward an increase in
the energy cost associated with the deformation of the lattice. Therefore, our
results suggest that filling fractions corresponding to doping relatively far
away from half-filling constitute the most promising regime to look for
coexistent ferroelectricity and metallic altermagnetism with mutual
enhancement. Moreover, we propose a way to electrically tune altermagnetism
between nodal and nodeless phases as well as achieving coexistence of a nodal
and nodeless phase for the two spin species.

Abstract: Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$N alloys are essential for high-performance optoelectronic
and power devices, yet the role of composition on defect energetics remains
underexplored, largely due to the limitations of first-principles methods in
modeling disordered alloys. To address this, we employ a machine learning
interatomic potential (MLIP) to investigate the structural and defect-related
physical properties in Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$N. The MLIP is first validated by
reproducing the equation of state, lattice constants, and elastic constants of
the binary endpoints, GaN and AlN, as well as known defect formation and
migration energies from density functional theory and empirical potentials. We
then apply the MLIP to evaluate elastic constants of AlGaN alloys, which
reveals a non-linear relation with alloying effect. Our results reveal that
nitrogen Frenkel pair formation energies and the migration barriers for
nitrogen point defects are highly sensitive to the local chemical environment
and migration path. In contrast, Ga and Al vacancy migration energies remain
relatively insensitive to alloy composition, whereas their interstitial
migration energies exhibit stronger compositional dependence. These results
provide quantitative insight into how alloying influences defect energetics in
AlGaN, informing defect engineering strategies for improved material
performance.

Abstract: Phase-change materials (PCMs) based on group IV, V, and VI elements, such as
Ge, Sb, and Te, exhibit distinctive liquid-state features, including
thermodynamic anomalies and unusual dynamical properties, which are believed to
play a key role in their fast and reversible crystallization behavior. Antimony
(Sb), a monoatomic PCM with ultrafast switching capabilities, stands out as the
only elemental member of this group for which the properties of the liquid and
supercooled states have so far remained unknown. In this work, we use
large-scale molecular dynamics simulations with a neural network potential
trained on first-principles data to investigate the liquid, supercooled, and
amorphous phases of Sb across a broad pressure-temperature range. We uncover
clear signatures of anomalous behavior, including a density maximum and
non-monotonic thermodynamic response functions, and introduce a novel
octahedral order parameter that captures the structural evolution of the
liquid. Moreover, extrapolation of the viscosity to the glass transition, based
on configurational and excess entropies, indicates that Sb is a highly fragile
material. Our results present a compelling new case for the connection between
the liquid-state properties of phase-change materials and their unique ability
to combine high amorphous-phase stability with ultrafast crystallization.

Abstract: We present an adaptive and parallel implementation of the Basin Hopping (BH)
algorithm for the global optimization of atomic clusters interacting via the
Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential. The method integrates local energy minimization
with adaptive step-size Monte Carlo moves and simultaneous evaluation of
multiple trial structures, enabling efficient exploration of complex potential
energy landscapes while maintaining a balance between exploration and
refinement. Parallel evaluation of candidate structures significantly reduces
wall-clock time, achieving nearly linear speedup for up to eight concurrent
local minimizations. This framework provides a practical and scalable strategy
to accelerate Basin Hopping searches, directly extendable to ab initio
calculations such as density functional theory (DFT) on high-performance
computing architectures.

Abstract: Effective Hamiltonians are powerful tools for understanding the emergent
phenomena in condensed matter systems. Reconstructing an effective Hamiltonian
directly from experimental data is challenging due to the complex relationship
between Hamiltonian parameters and observables. Complimentary to ARPES, which
probes surface electronic properties, bulk-sensitive techniques based on HHG
and HSG have shown strong potential for Hamiltonian reconstruction. Here, we
reconstruct an effective three-band electron-hole Hamiltonian in bulk GaAs
based on HSG. Based on previous understanding of HSG in bulk GaAs in terms of
Bloch-wave interferometry, an analytic model is derived to quantitatively
connect the Hamiltonian parameters with the measured sideband electric fields
under strong, low-frequency THz fields. Assuming that the exciton reduced mass
and the parameter that defines the hole Bloch wavefunctions in bulk GaAs are
known from existing absorbance and HSG experiments, we show that the bandgap of
GaAs, two dephasing constants associated with two electron-hole species, and an
additional Hamiltonian parameter that determines the electron-hole reduced
masses, can be simultaneously and unambiguously determined through Bloch-wave
interferometry. We thus demonstrate the full capability of Hamiltonian
reconstruction by combining absorbance spectroscopy and HSG experiments. We
find that the extracted bandgap of GaAs is approximately 13\,meV higher than
the expected value based on previous absorbance measurements. Quantum kinetic
analysis suggests that, in the HSG experiments, the electron-hole energy could
have been renormalized through Fr\"ohlich interaction that is modified by the
strong THz fields. We also show that the energy threshold in emission of
optical phonons can be suppressed by applying a strong THz field, leading to
nearly constant dephasing rates.

Abstract: A triangular Co-ion lattice intercalated between 1-H NbS$_2$ layers can
exhibit a large anomalous Hall effect (AHE) due to the finite scalar spin
chirality originating from the non-coplanar $3q$ ordering of Co spins. This
large AHE occurs when the scalar spin chirality is uniform in all Co layers, as
indeed found in the Co$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$ case [Phys. Rev. Mater. 6, 024201
(2022)]. However, if the spin chirality were staggered with the opposite signs
in the adjacent Co layers, the net AHE would disappear, yielding instead the
topological magneto-electric effect. Here, we theoretically verify that a
transverse electric field generates a finite orbital magnetization under such
conditions, consistent with the axion-like coupling. Using first-principles
calculations, we show that the resulting magneto-electric coupling,
$\alpha^{zz}$ can be as large as 0.9 $e^2/2h$. We also demonstrate that the
inter-layer magnetic coupling in these materials can be tuned by strain,
enabling the switching between the AHE and the axionic states.

Abstract: Heat conduction and radiation are two of the three fundamental modes of heat
transfer, playing a critical role in a wide range of scientific and engineering
applications ranging from energy systems to materials science. However,
traditional physics-based simulation methods for modeling these processes often
suffer from prohibitive computational costs. In recent years, the rapid
advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have
demonstrated remarkable potential in the modeling of nanoscale heat conduction
and radiation. This review presents a comprehensive overview of recent
AI-driven developments in modeling heat conduction and radiation at the
nanoscale. We first discuss the ML techniques for predicting phonon properties,
including phonon dispersion and scattering rates, which are foundational for
determining material thermal properties. Next, we explore the role of
machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) in molecular dynamics
simulations and their applications to bulk materials, low-dimensional systems,
and interfacial transport. We then review the ML approaches for solving
radiative heat transfer problems, focusing on data-driven solutions to
Maxwell's equations and the radiative transfer equation. We further discuss the
ML-accelerated inverse design of radiative energy devices, including
optimization-based and generative model-based methods. Finally, we discuss open
challenges and future directions, including data availability, model
generalization, uncertainty quantification, and interpretability. Through this
survey, we aim to provide a foundational understanding of how AI techniques are
reshaping thermal science and guiding future research in nanoscale heat
transfer.

Abstract: This paper systematically reviews the research progress and application
prospects of machine learning technologies in the field of polymer materials.
Currently, machine learning methods are developing rapidly in polymer material
research; although they have significantly accelerated material prediction and
design, their complexity has also caused difficulties in understanding and
application for researchers in traditional fields. In response to the above
issues, this paper first analyzes the inherent challenges in the research and
development of polymer materials, including structural complexity and the
limitations of traditional trial-and-error methods. To address these problems,
it focuses on introducing key basic technologies such as molecular descriptors
and feature representation, data standardization and cleaning, and records a
number of high-quality polymer databases. Subsequently, it elaborates on the
key role of machine learning in polymer property prediction and material
design, covering the specific applications of algorithms such as traditional
machine learning, deep learning, and transfer learning; further, it deeply
expounds on data-driven design strategies, such as reverse design,
high-throughput virtual screening, and multi-objective optimization. The paper
also systematically introduces the complete process of constructing
high-reliability machine learning models and summarizes effective experimental
verification, model evaluation, and optimization methods. Finally, it
summarizes the current technical challenges in research, such as data quality
and model generalization ability, and looks forward to future development
trends including multi-scale modeling, physics-informed machine learning,
standardized data sharing, and interpretable machine learning.

Abstract: We revisit the problem of deceleration of a charge moving in a medium. Going
beyond the traditional approach, which relies on Ehrenfest dynamics, we treat
the projectile fully quantum mechanically, on the same footing as the electrons
of the target. In order to separate the dynamics of the projectile from that of
the electrons, we employ the Exact Factorization method. We illustrate the
resulting theory by applying it to the problem of the stopping power (SP) of a
jellium-model metal for slowly moving charges. The quantum mechanical nature of
particles manifests itself remarkably in the differences in the SP for
projectiles of the same charge moving with the same velocity, but having
different masses.

Abstract: We investigate the influence of AlN buffer thickness on the structural,
electrical, and thermal properties of AlGaN/GaN high-electron mobility
transistors (HEMTs) grown on semi-insulating SiC substrates by metal-organic
chemical vapor deposition. X-ray diffraction and atomic force microscopy reveal
that while thin AlN layers (120 nm) exhibit compressive strain and smooth
step-flow surfaces, thicker single-layer buffers (550 nm) develop tensile
strain and increased surface roughness. Multi-layer buffer structures up to 2
{\mu}m alleviate strain and maintain surface integrity. Low-temperature Hall
measurements confirm that electron mobility decreases with increasing interface
roughness, with the highest mobility observed in the structure with a thin AlN
buffer. Transient thermoreflectance measurements show that thermal conductivity
(ThC) of the AlN buffer increases with the thickness, reaching 188 W/m.K at 300
K for the 2 {\mu}m buffer layer, which is approximately 60% of the bulk AlN ThC
value. These results highlight the importance of optimizing AlN buffer design
to balance strain relaxation, thermal management, and carrier transport for
high-performance GaN-based HEMTs.

Abstract: The emergence of hidden spin polarization in centrosymmetric nonmagnetic
crystals due to local symmetry breaking has created new opportunities for
potential spintronic applications and for enhancing our understanding of
mechanisms to electrically manipulate spin-related phenomena. In this work, we
investigate within density functional theory the properties of the hidden spin
texture and spin-layer segregation in a prototype centrosymmetric
dichalcogenide-monolayer material using an electric-field-based method. This
method is shown to yield a precise and robust alternative to traditional
layer-projected spin-polarization techniques for obtaining the intrinsic hidden
spin textures in such materials. Moreover, it gives access at the same time to
the spatial distribution within the monolayer of the individual spin-segregated
states responsible for the hidden spin textures, not provided by other
techniques. With this approach we determine and study the hidden spin textures
of the upper valence bands of the PtTe2 monolayer together with the spatial
behavior of the probability densities and spin polarization densities of the
corresponding maximally segregated spin states. This combined study enabled by
the electric-field method yields new insights into the mechanisms controlling
the spin-layer segregation and resulting hidden spin texture in such systems.
We also discuss the symmetry rules governing the shape in the Brillouin zone of
the hidden spin texture, which can be straightforwardly predicted within the
present framework.

Abstract: Uniaxial spintronic heterostructures constitute compact THz emitters under
femtosecond excitation, with emission amplitude and polarization governed by
the applied magnetic field. We demonstrate here efficient magnetically tunable
THz amplitude control in ultrathin, exchange-biased Co/Pt/Co/IrMn spin valve
heterostructures. Terahertz spintronic magnetometry resolves reversible
switching between parallel and antiparallel magnetization states and correlates
the high- and low-emission regimes with constructive and destructive
interference of charge transients generated by the inverse spin Hall effect in
the Pt spacer. A residual low-emission signal is traced to spin-to-charge
conversion in IrMn. Phase inversion under front- versus back-side excitation
confirms the ISHE origin, while a macrospin Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert model
reproduces the field dependence and separates layer-specific contributions.
Together, these results define a wafer-compatible spin valve device
architecture that enables efficient, low-field THz amplitude control.

Abstract: As interest in sustainable materials grows, paper is being reimagined as a
multifunctional substrate with significant potential for future technologies
for innovative, environmentally friendly solutions. This study investigates the
swelling behavior and environmental responsiveness of a copolymer,
poly(N,N-dimethylacrylamide-co-4-methacryloyloxybenzophenone)
(P(DMAA-co-MABP)), when applied to cellulosic paper for use in
humidity-sensitive actuators. The copolymer's swelling behavior was
characterized using dynamic vapor sorption (DVS) and in-situ atomic force
microscopy (AFM). DVS measurements demonstrated that the polymer coating
significantly enhances the hygroscopic properties of the paper, while AFM
revealed the polymer's fast response to relative humidity (RH) changes, shown
by immediate height adjustments, increased adhesion, and decreased stiffness at
higher RH levels.Studies on polymer-modified paper-based bilayer actuators
demonstrate that incorporating the hydrophilic P(DMAA-co-MABP) results in
actuation in response to relative humidity variations between 10% and 90% RH.
From these findings, two models were proposed to assess key mechanisms in the
swelling behavior: the correlation between the heterogeneity in crosslinking
and the polymer swelling behavior, and the correlation between polymer-paper
interactions and the hygro-responsive bending behavior. Additionally, thermal
analysis was performed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC), providing a comprehensive profile of the
copolymer's behavior.

Abstract: Two-dimensional bismuth (Bi) is a promising platform for quantum and energy

Bi with fast research turnaround remains challenging. We report a controlled
colloidal synthesis of Bi nanosheets with tunable lateral sizes (0.6 - 4.1 um),
hexagonal shape, and a layered single-crystalline structure along the {00l}

in excellent agreement with DFT calculations, confirming high crystal quality

two-dimensional Bi, paving the way for fundamental studies and integration into
next-generation quantum and energy devices.

Abstract: The magnetic ground state of RuO$_2$ has been under intense debate. Using
first-principles calculations, we show that compressive strain along [001]
direction stabilizes an altermagnetic phase in RuO$_2$ thin films grown on
(100) and (110) TiO$_2$ substrates. We further identify that compressive strain
enhances the density of states near the Fermi level, resulting in a Fermi
surface instability and the emergence of altermagnetism. The magnitude of
strain and the associated increase in the density of states can be tuned by
varying the film thickness, as systematically confirmed by x-ray diffraction
and photoemission spectroscopy measurements. Symmetry analysis further reveals
that (100) RuO$_2$ hosts an ideal altermagnetic order, whereas broken symmetry
in (110) films leads to an uncompensated ferrimagnetic state. Finally, we
discuss the effects of Hubbard $U$ parameters and evaluate the realistic
tunneling magnetoresistance of (100) RuO$_2$.

Abstract: Helium and rare gases (RG: Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe) are typically considered
chemically inert, yet under the extreme pressures of planetary interiors they
may form compounds with unexpected properties. Using crystal structure
prediction and first-principles calculations, we mapped the phase diagram of
binary He-RG systems up to $1$ TPa. We identify several previously unknown
stoichiometric compounds that are both thermodynamically and vibrationally
stable at sub-terapascal pressures, within the reach of modern high-pressure
experiments. In particular, AHe$_{2}$ and AHe (A: Ar, Kr, Xe) adopt previously
unreported orthorhombic, hexagonal and cubic phases that remain stable over
wide pressure ranges. We further find that He-Xe systems host metallic and
excitonic insulator phases at pressures nearly an order of magnitude lower than
those required for pure helium, offering a pathway to realize these exotic
quantum states experimentally. Finite-temperature simulations also reveal
superionic He-Xe phases, in which helium ions diffuse either anisotropically or
isotropically depending on the host lattice. These findings constitute the
first prediction of helium-based systems that combine metallicity and
superionicity, with profound implications for energy transport and planetary
dynamo processes. Overall, our results demonstrate that mixing helium with
heavier rare gases provides an effective strategy to stabilize metallic,
excitonic insulator, and superionic phases at experimentally accessible
pressures, opening new research directions for condensed matter physics and
planetary science.

Abstract: Ferroelectric materials are a class of dielectrics that exhibit spontaneous
polarization which can be reversed under an external electric field. The
emergence of ferroelectric order in incipient ferroelectrics is a topic of
considerable interest from both fundamental and applied perspectives. Among the
various strategies explored, strain engineering has been proven to be a
powerful method for tuning ferroelectric polarization in materials. In the case
of KTaO3, first principles calculations have suggested that strain can drive a
ferroelectric phase transition. In this study, we investigate the impact of
in-plane uniaxial and biaxial strain, ranging from 0% to 1%, on pristine KTaO3
to explore its potential for ferroelectricity induction via inversion symmetry
breaking. By integrating density functional theory calculations with the
stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation assisted by on the fly
machine learned force field, we obtain accurate structural information and
dynamical properties under varying strain conditions while incorporating
higher-order anharmonic effects. Employing the Berry phase method, we obtained
the ferroelectric polarization of the strained structures over the entire
temperature range up to 300 K. Our findings provide valuable insights into the
role of strain in stabilizing ferroelectricity in KTaO3, offering guidance for
future experimental and theoretical studies on strain-engineered ferroelectric
materials.
