The complete set of these\ncoordinates, evaluated across rotationally symmetric lattice frames, fully\ndefines the carbon cap structure. This rule establishes that chirality is\nencoded deterministically at nucleation, as any perturbation to the pentagon\npositions overwhelmingly leads to a predictable, quanti able, and entropically\nirreversible shift in (n,m). We further explain the preferential formation of\nthe (126) nanotube by identifying a six-fold symmetric cap with epitaxial\nmatching to the <111> catalyst facet. Our work provides a theoretical framework\nthat redefines the field, shifting the focus from growth kinetics to\ndeterministic nucleation programming and paving the way toward predictable\nsynthesis."}

This extreme sub-thermal photoemission signal is\nconsistent with direct emission of electrons photoexcited from the Fe dopant\nstates into the low effective mass and positive electron affinity primary\nconduction band, and it is superimposed on a stronger signal with a larger MTE\nassociated with an (optical)phonon-mediated momentum resonant Franck-Condon\n(FC) emission process from a thermally populated and negative electron affinity\nupper conduction band. For photon energies above 4.5eV, a transition from a\nlong to a short transport regime is forced by an absorption depth reduction to\nbelow 100nm and both MTE signals exhibit spectral trends consistent with\nphonon-mediated FC emission if the polaron formation self-energy is included in\nthe initial photoexcited electron thermalization."}

However, its strong\ntendency to crystallize during processing limits optical performance. While\nmicrogravity environments have been shown to suppress crystallization, the role\nof mechanical vibration under normal gravity conditions remains poorly\nunderstood. This study systematically investigates the influence of vibration\non the crystallization behavior of ZBLAN using a controlled heating and\nvibration apparatus. Samples were subjected to varied thermal and vibrational\nconditions, and their crystallization onset and morphological evolution were\nexamined through optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy\ndispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Results\nshow that vibration reduces the crystallization onset temperature, indicating\nenhanced atomic mobility and nucleation kinetics. Progressive morphological\ntransitions from needle-like to bow-tie and feather-like crystals were observed\nwith increasing temperature and vibration intensity. Surface roughness analysis\ncorroborates these findings, revealing a significant increase in nanoscale\nroughness in crystallized regions. Although brief exposure duration and partial\nthermal decoupling introduced variability among samples, the overall results\nconfirm that vibration acts as a direct facilitator of nucleation rather than a\npurely thermal effect. This work provides new insight into vibration-induced\ncrystallization in fluoride glasses and establishes the experimental foundation\nfor follow-up modeling and apparatus optimization studies under terrestrial and\nmicrogravity conditions."}

The technique\nuses a combinatorial microwave-optical pump-probe scheme, leveraging both the\nhigh-energy resolution of microwaves and the high-efficiency detection using\noptical photons. In contrast to conventional stroboscopy using a\ncontinuous-wave light, we apply microwave and optical pulses with varying pulse\nwidths, and demonstrate magnetooptical detection of magnetization dynamics in\nY3Fe5O12 films. The detected magneto-optical signals strongly depend on the\ncharacteristics of both the microwave and the optical pulses as well as their\nrelative time delays. We show that good magneto-optical sensitivity and\ncoherent stroboscopic character are maintained even at a microwave pump pulse\nof 1.5 ns and an optical probe pulse of 80 ps, under a 7 megahertz clock rate,\ncorresponding to a pump-probe footprint of ~1% in one detection cycle.

This transition is driven by Joule heating at room temperature.\nElectrical transport measurements reveal that both the switching threshold\nvoltage and the resistance of the NC-CDW phase exhibit clear, reversible strain\ndependence. Furthermore, we identify a quadratic dependence between the\nstrain-induced resistance change and the threshold voltage, confirming that\npiezoresistive modulation governs the strain-tunability of the phase\ntransition. We demonstrate a room-temperature, electrically-readout strain and\ndisplacement sensor with threshold-like response in a programmable window.\nThese results highlight the potential of 1T-TaS2 for on-chip sensing of strain\nand displacement."}

Here, we study how these properties are influenced by the interlayer\nDzyaloshinskii--Moriya interaction (IL-DMI), which stabilizes twin-skyrmions in\nmagnetic bilayers. We find that the spin configuration of the twin-skyrmion\nadapts to the direction of the IL-DMI by elongating or changing the helicities\nin the two layers. Driving the skyrmions by spin-polarized currents in the\ncurrent-perpendicular-to-plane configuration, we observe significant changes\neither in the skyrmion velocity or in the skyrmion Hall angle depending on the\ncurrent polarization. These findings unravel further prospects for skyrmion\nmanipulation enabled by the IL-DMI."}
