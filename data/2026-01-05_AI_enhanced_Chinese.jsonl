Here, we introduce a spectral sampling framework to quantify boron diffusion activation energies in Ni and demonstrate how substitutional solutes (Cr, Mo) reshape interstitial point defect transport in both the bulk and along crystallographic defects. In the bulk, boron migration energy distributions exhibit distinct modality tied to solute identity and spatial arrangement: both Cr and Mo raise barriers in symmetric cages but induce directional asymmetry in partially decorated environments. Extending this framework to a $\\Sigma5\\langle100\\rangle{210}$ symmetric tilt grain boundary reveals solute-specific confinement effects. Cr preserves low-barrier in-plane mobility while suppressing out-of-plane transport, guiding boron into favorable midplane voids. Mo, by contrast, imposes an across-the-board reduction in boron mobility, suppressing average diffusivity by two additional orders of magnitude at 800 $^\\circ$C and reducing out-of-plane transport by five orders of magnitude relative to Cr. Both elements promote segregation by producing negative segregation energies, but their roles diverge: Cr facilitates rapid redistribution and stabilization at interfacial sites, consistent with Cr-rich boride formation, while Mo creates deeper and more uniform segregation wells that strongly anchor boron. Together, these complementary behaviors explain the experimental prevalence of Cr- and Mo-rich borides at grain boundaries and carbide interfaces in Ni-based superalloys.

It reproduces classical tilings, including the Ammann--Beenker, the Niizeki--G\u00e4hler, and the square and hexagonal Fibonacci tilings. It also uncovers new tilings not likely to arise in conventional constructions, with relative frequencies of local configurations that may take transcendental values. The near-coincidence method is algorithmically simple and already realized in an application that generates tilings from specified layer parameters and coincidence conditions. Future extensions include trilayer systems, where preliminary results yield dodecagonal order with square layers, and very small twist angles, where the method may capture the giant moir\u00e9 patterns of bilayer and trilayer graphene.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The inclusion of a QPC breaks electron-hole (e-h) symmetry, leading to a finite thermovoltage. In contrast, earlier studies on hybrid junctions incorporating insulating barriers, as e-h symmetry is preserved, have vanishing thermovoltage, and consequently, $\u0394_T$ noise is calculated at zero thermovoltage. In our setup, the broken e-h symmetry allows for a finite thermovoltage, at which we compute the corresponding $\u0394_T$ noise. Unlike earlier studies restricted by e-h symmetry and vanishing thermovoltage, our work establishes a self-consistent framework in mesoscopic hybrid junctions, revealing how Andreev reflection fundamentally reshapes $\u0394_T$ noise once e-h symmetry is broken. This broad access to charge fluctuation signatures provides a more comprehensive understanding of non-equilibrium transport in linear response. To our knowledge, this work provides the first self-consistent analysis of $\u0394_T$ noise in superconducting hybrid junctions where e-h symmetry is broken, explicitly revealing how Andreev reflection modifies $\u0394_T$ noise beyond the symmetry-protected zero-thermovoltage regime.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Using the Keldysh formalism within the non-equilibrium Green's function framework, we derive analytical expressions for radiative power, force, and torque. To enable angular momentum radiation, an out-of-plane magnetic field is applied to break reciprocity, resulting in gyrotropic terms in the permittivity tensor. By approximating the emitter as a thin film, the photon Green's functions can be solved analytically. Expressions for the Poynting vector and Maxwell's stress tensor can subsequently be extracted from the lesser Green's function, which governs the field correlations. The final radiation formulas can be expressed in terms of Fresnel coefficients, revealing an insightful connection to energy conservation via Kirchhoff's law. Using the Wigner transform, the analytical expression for the radiative torque can also be related to the generalized Fresnel coefficients. Numerical calculations based on the optical conductivity of bismuth are presented to corroborate the analytical results.

We employ large-scale molecular dynamics simulations on Al-6.8%Cu nanoparticles to explore atomic-scale mechanisms governing the full thermal sintering cycle. We demonstrate that while the sintering temperature primarily initiates neck formation, the subsequent cooling rate is the dominant kinetic parameter dictating the final microstructure. Fast cooling rates trap a significantly higher density of stacking faults and can unexpectedly lead to the formation of an amorphous phase at the interparticle interfaces, a feature critically dependent on the rate of thermal dissipation. We confirm a clear shift in the coalescence mechanism from plastic deformation (dislocation slip) at low temperatures (300 K and 450 K) to mass transport via atomic diffusion at high temperatures (600 K). These findings provide essential, atomic-scale guidelines for controlling thermal processing, particularly cooling rates, to design defect-stabilized, high-performance Al-Cu components.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In closed quantum mechanical or/and coherent wave-based systems the Hamiltonian is introduced as a Hermitian operator which ensures real energy spectrum and secures the decomposition of any state over a complete basis set spanning the space where the states live. Pseudo-Hermitian, or PT symmetric, systems are a special class of non-Hermitian ones. They describe open systems but may still have real energy spectrum. The eigenmodes are however not orthogonal in general. This qualitative difference to Hermitian physics has a range of consequences for the physical behaviour of the system in the steady state or when it is subjected to external perturbations. This overview reviews the recent progress in the field of pseudo-Hermitian physics as it unfolds when applied to low-energy excitations of magnetically ordered materials. The focus is mainly on long wave length spin excitations (spin waves) with magnons being the energy quanta of these excitations. Various setups including ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, magnonic crystals, and hybride structures with different types of coupling to the environments as well as spatio-temporally engineered systems will be discussed with a focus on the particular aspects that are brought about by the pseudo-Hermiticity such as mode amplifications, non-reciprocal propagation, magnon cloaking, non-Hermitian skin effect, PT-symmetric assisted Floquet engineering, topological energy transfer, and field-induced enhanced sensitivity.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Using first-principles calculations, we predict emergent sliding ferroelectricity and doping-mediated ferromagnetism in bilayer (BL) InSe. The energetically favored AB stacked BL-InSe spontaneously breaks the out-of-plane mirror symmetry, resulting in a switchable polarization with a saturated component of 0.089 pC/m and a low transition barrier of 28.8 meV per unit cell. Strikingly, low-concentration electrostatic doping enhances rather than suppresses the ferroelectric polarization due to the abnormal layer-dependent electronic occupation in BL-InSe, in contrast to the conventional screening paradigm. In addition, the characteristic Mexican-hat-shaped valence band enables doping-induced itinerant half-metallic ferromagnetism, where the interlayer spin density difference scales linearly with doping concentration and can be reversed by switching the polarization direction. These results demonstrate the coexistence of ferroelectric and ferromagnetic orders in BL-InSe and establish a viable platform for realizing voltage-tunable multiferroicity through stacking and carrier doping in otherwise nonpolar and nonmagnetic semiconductors.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
