Based on previous understanding of HSG in bulk GaAs in terms of\nBloch-wave interferometry, an analytic model is derived to quantitatively\nconnect the Hamiltonian parameters with the measured sideband electric fields\nunder strong, low-frequency THz fields. Assuming that the exciton reduced mass\nand the parameter that defines the hole Bloch wavefunctions in bulk GaAs are\nknown from existing absorbance and HSG experiments, we show that the bandgap of\nGaAs, two dephasing constants associated with two electron-hole species, and an\nadditional Hamiltonian parameter that determines the electron-hole reduced\nmasses, can be simultaneously and unambiguously determined through Bloch-wave\ninterferometry.

Vu", "Hiori Kino"], "title": "Superconductor discovery in the emerging paradigm of Materials Informatics", "comment": null, "summary": "The last two decades have witnessed a tremendous number of computational\npredictions of hydride-based (phonon-mediated) superconductors, mostly at\nextremely high pressures, i.e., hundreds of GPa. These discoveries were heavily\ndriven by Migdal-\\'{E}liashberg theory (and its first-principles computational\nimplementations) for electron-phonon interactions, the key concept of\nphonon-mediated superconductivity. Dozens of predictions were experimentally\nsynthesized and characterized, triggering not only enormous excitement in the\ncommunity but also some debates. In this Article, we review the\ncomputational-driven discoveries and the recent developments in the field from\nvarious essential aspects, including the theoretical, computational, and,\nspecifically, artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) based\napproaches emerging within the paradigm of materials informatics. While\nchallenges and critical gaps can be found in all of these approaches, AI/ML\nefforts specifically remain in its infant stage for good reasons. However,\nopportunities exist when these approaches can be further developed and\nintegrated in concerted efforts, in which AI/ML approaches could play more\nimportant roles."}

In this work, we measured the SC gap in\nhigh-quality single crystal of \\beta-PdBi2 by using high-resolution laser\nangle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy below Tc. We found the isotropic SC\ngaps in momentum space for multiple bands, and observed that the difference\nbetween the SC gap of the topological surface bands and the bulk bands is about\n0.1 meV, consistent with other experimental results. These direct and\nquantitative experimental results support the possibility of \\beta-PdBi2 as a\ntopological superconductor, characterized by unique crystal and electronic band\nstructures."}

While their behavior in equilibrium is well-understood\ntheoretically, the nonequilibrium regime at high excitation densities-where\nphenomena like electron-hole liquids emerge - is less explored. This thesis\npresents a first-principles study of excitons in two-dimensional materials. We\nuse the GW approximation and the Bethe-Salpeter equation to investigate their\nproperties from equilibrium to nonequilibrium conditions. We first demonstrate\nhow increasing photo-excited carrier density leads to a redshift-blueshift\ncrossover of excitons. We then show that electron-phonon interactions\ncritically modify optical spectra and exciton lifetimes at finite temperatures.\nFinally, we unify these effects to demonstrate the formation of an\nelectron-hole liquid phase above a critical carrier density and below a\ncritical temperature. Our work identifies how enhanced Coulomb interactions in\ntwo dimensions can stabilize this phase at significantly higher temperatures,\nproposing promising material candidates for observing these collective states."}

This\nstudy investigates the effects of controlled atomic hydrogen exposure on young\nand mature soot nanoparticles, generated in premixed ethylene-air flames, and\ndeposited on substrates. We employed a multi-technique approach to characterize\nthe chemical, mechanical, and electrical evolution of the films. In-situ\ninfrared spectroscopy revealed non-monotonic behavior: an initial increase in\naliphatic CH bonds was observed, followed by a decrease at higher hydrogen\nfluences. This was accompanied by a continuous decrease in the aromatic C=C\nsignal. Atomic force microscopy showed a significant increase in the Young's\nmodulus of the film for both sample types after hydrogenation. This mechanical\nchange was correlated with an increase in the I(D)/I(G) ratio from Raman\nspectroscopy. Furthermore, both macroscopic current vs. voltage and local\nscanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements demonstrated a notable increase in\nelectrical conductivity. For single just-formed soot particles, moreover, a\nhydrogen-induced transformation from a semiconductive to a semi-metallic nature\nwas observed. The collective evidence points towards an H-induced CC\ncross-linking mechanism within the nanoparticle films. We propose that atomic\nhydrogen facilitates the formation of radical sites, which promotes covalent\nbond formation between adjacent particles or molecular units, creating a more\ninterconnected and rigid network, with smaller interlayer distance. These\nfindings provide crucial insights into the structural evolution of carbonaceous\nmaterials in hydrogen-rich environments, with direct implications for\nunderstanding soot formation and for the tailored design of carbon-based\nmaterials."}
