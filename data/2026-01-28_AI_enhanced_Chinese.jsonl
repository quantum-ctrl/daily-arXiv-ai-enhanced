C2NP defines two complementary tasks: (i) generating nanoparticles of specified radii from periodic unit cells, testing whether models capture surface truncation and geometric constraints; and (ii) recovering bulk lattice parameters and space-group symmetry from finite particle configurations, assessing whether models can infer underlying crystallographic order despite surface perturbations. Using diverse materials as a structurally consistent testbed, we construct over 170,000 nanoparticle configurations by carving particles from supercells derived from DFT-relaxed crystal unit cells, and introduce size-based splits that separate interpolation from extrapolation regimes. Experiments with state-of-the-art approaches, including diffusion, flow-matching, and variational models, show that even when losses are low, models often fail geometrically under distribution shift, yielding large lattice-recovery errors and near-zero joint accuracy on structure and symmetry.

However, as these architectures scale toward artificial Kitaev chains with phase-control loops, local accessibility becomes restricted, constraining conventional local parity control and detection. While Andreev molecules offer a platform for non-local intervention, deterministic protocols for parity manipulation have yet to be experimentally established. Here, we demonstrate deterministic non-local control over the parity configuration of a quantum dot (QD) by electrically modulating the coherent hybridization with a spatially adjacent QD within an Andreev molecule. By systematically investigating three distinct joint parity configuration regimes in the elastic co-tunneling limit, we experimentally uncover the operational conditions for this non-local control. In conjunction with theoretical simulations establishing a global phase diagram, we identify a set of universal selection rules governing parity transitions, dictated by the symmetry-imposed interplay between the joint parity configuration and the dominant inter-dot coupling mechanism (elastic co-tunneling vs. crossed Andreev reflection). Furthermore, we establish the supercurrent, directly signaled by zero-bias conductance peaks, as an intrinsic, sensor-free probe of the parity configuration, obviating the need for auxiliary charge sensors.

By comparing the experimental results with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we have identified dispersive surface states originating from different terminations of the Na$_2$KSb(111) surface. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the crystalline order of the film is preserved following its activation via the deposition of Cs and Sb. This finding opens a pathway for investigating the electronic structure of multialkali Na$_2$KSb(Cs) photocathodes and for rationally improving their properties.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We compare different methods for quantifying GNDs, all of which originate from the Nye tensor, which is computed as the curl of the plastic deformation gradient. The projection technique directly decomposes the Nye tensor onto individual screw and edge dislocation components to compute GNDs. This approach requires converting a nine-component Nye tensor into densities for a larger number of dislocation systems, a fundamentally underdetermined (non-unique) process, which is resolved using $L2$ minimization. In contrast, when employing CPFE analysis, one could directly compute dislocation densities on each slip system using shear gradients. Projection and slip gradient methods are compared with respect to their prediction of GNDs with changing grain size, strain, and grain neighborhoods, including multigrain junctions. Although these techniques match analytical GND densities for single slip, single crystal deformation, and are consistent with anticipated overall GND trends, we find that the GND densities from projection techniques are significantly lower than those predicted from CPFE-based slip gradients in polycrystals. A suggested improvement of only using the active dislocation systems in the projection technique almost entirely resolved this mismatch.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Here, we introduce a polymer-free method for clean, rapid, and high-yield assembly of hermetically encapsulated suspended samples of air-sensitive monolayers. Applying it to di-iodides enables atomic resolution characterisation of thin samples - down to the monolayer limit - for the first time. Our imaging, combined with complementary first-principles calculations, reveals an unusually small energy barrier between alternate stable stacking polytypes in few-layer films, enabling extrinsic control of the stacking phase. We also observe stable isolated iodine vacancies that do not aggregate to form extended structures, and identify and verify the stability of the various edge configurations of thin samples. These results establish the unique structural characteristics of these materials in the thin limit, and more broadly demonstrate the utility of our transfer platform for creating atomically clean suspended vdW heterostructures.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
