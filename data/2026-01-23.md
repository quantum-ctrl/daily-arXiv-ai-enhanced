Abstract: Identifying and understanding non-BCS superconductivity remains a central challenge in condensed-matter physics. Here we focus on the Sc$_{6}$MTe$_{2}$ family (M =d-electron metal), which provides a unique platform of isostructural compounds exhibiting superconductivity across 3d, 4d, and 5d systems. Using hydrostatic pressure as an additional tuning parameter, muon-spin rotation ($μ$SR) and AC susceptibility measurements uncover strongly contrasting pressure responses of superconductivity across the Sc$_{6}$MTe$_{2}$ series. The superconducting transition temperature, $T_{\rm C}$ decreases under pressure in the 3d Fe-based compound but increases for the 4d Ru- and 5d Ir-based systems, with the Ru compound showing the largest enhancement of nearly 50% within 2 GPa. The superfluid density exhibits similarly distinct pressure dependences, remaining nearly pressure independent for Fe while decreasing with increasing pressure for Ru and Ir. This suggests fundamentally different correlations between $T_{\rm C}$ and the superfluid density. Together, these results indicate that superconductivity emerging from strongly correlated and spin-orbit-dominated regimes in Sc$_{6}$MTe$_{2}$ is likely governed by different microscopic mechanisms and offer a useful experimental basis for future microscopic theoretical studies.

Abstract: To investigate the interplay between charge density wave (CDW) and superconductivity, we performed ultralow-temperature spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy on the cleaved surface of the layered superconductor 2H-NbSe2. We found that the superconducting-gap spectrum exhibits intricate structures reflecting the anisotropic gaps opening on multiple Fermi surfaces. Notably, none of the characteristic energy scales apparent in the spectral gap show appreciable spatial variations, suggesting that the finite-momentum pairing is negligible. Instead, the spectral weight near the coherence peak is modulated with the same periodicity as the CDW. The maximum position of the coherence-peak-weight modulation coincides with neither the peak nor the bottom of the CDW modulation; rather, it aligns with the center of one of the two inequivalent triangular plaquettes that comprise the CDW unit cell. This distribution pattern of Bogoliubov quasiparticles directly results from the broken in-plane inversion symmetry at the surface of 2H-NbSe2, which may activate Ising spin-orbit coupling.

Abstract: In type-II superconductors, magnetic fields modulate the amplitude and phase of the superconducting order parameter, forming quantized vortices where superconductivity is locally suppressed and exotic bound states or competing electronic orders emerge. Using spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy on epitaxial Ba(Fe$_{0.94}Co$_{0.06})$_2$As$_2$ films, we discover an incommensurate charge-stripe order aligned with the Fe-Fe bond direction and nucleated inside magnetic vortices. These charge modulations intensify at the vortex core, extend far into the vortex halo, and persist within the superconducting gap. Strikingly, the charge order modulates Andreev bound states of vortices at non-zero energies, producing abelian vortices with half-odd-integer level quantization and non-abelian vortices with integer-quantized core states that host a Majorana zero mode. The distinct vortex types are distinguished by the registry of their centers relative to the charge-stripe pattern and remain robust in ultrathin (2.5-unit-cell) films. Our findings reveal a density-wave-textured vortex matter and provide fresh insights into the intertwined phenomena of charge-stripe order, pair-density-wave modulations, and Majorana physics in iron-based superconductors.

Abstract: Topological semimetals are renowned for exhibiting large, unsaturated magnetoresistance arising from ultrahigh carrier mobility and electron-hole compensation. However, such behaviors remain poorly understood in iron-based superconductors that have been recently recognized to harbor rich nontrivial topology. Here, we combine angle-resolved magneto-transport measurements with first principles calculations to reveal the emergence and tunability of topological semimetals in ferropnictide Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_{2+δ}As$_2$ epitaxial films, modulated by interstitial Fe. These states exhibit ultralow residual resistivity, coexisting high-mobility electron and hole carriers, and linear positive magnetoresistance below 110 K. Remarkably, the magnetoresistance becomes more pronounced when the magnetic field is applied parallel to the film plane, reaching an unsaturated 1206% at 56 T. Furthermore, superconductivity persists in these ferropnictide films, establishing them as a tunable platform for investigating the interplay among electron correlation, topology, and superconductivity.

Abstract: Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) have emerged as the highest performing photon-counting detectors, making them a critical technology in quantum photonics and photon-starved optical sensing. However, the performance of SNSPDs is limited not by the intrinsic properties of the superconducting film, but by edge-induced current crowding. Despite extensive materials optimization and increasingly demanding fabrication strategies aimed at mitigating this edge-limited behavior, the device edges continue to limit the maximum device operating current, thereby degrading key performance metrics. Here, we demonstrate for the first time in situ tuning of a detector from an edge-limited to a bulk-limited regime, allowing the device to reach its intrinsic performance limit. Our approach is based on current-biased superconducting "rails" placed on either side of the detector to suppress current crowding at the edges. We show that activation of the rails reduces the dark count rate by nine orders of magnitude and extends the photon detection plateau at 1550 nm by more than 40%. These results are demonstrated on detectors up to 0.1 mm wide, establishing an entirely new class of ultra-wide strip detectors that we call superconducting strip photon detectors (SSPD). Moreover, the ability to suppress edge current crowding using the rails provides a pathway toward SSPDs with strip widths extending into the mm-scale. Such devices will enable large-area, high efficiency SSPD arrays with infrared sensitivity and open new opportunities in applications ranging from biomedical imaging to deep space optical communication.

Abstract: Graphynes offer a chemically heterogeneous $sp/sp^{2}$ carbon framework with distinct electronic regimes and site-selective reactivity. Here, Density Functional Theory and Reactive Molecular Dynamics Simulations are combined to evaluate pristine, B-doped, N-doped, and B-N co-doped $γ$-graphyne and 6,6,12-graphyne (meta/ortho/para). $γ$-graphyne is a semiconductor, while 6,6,12-graphyne exhibits an anisotropic Dirac-like semi-metallic dispersion. B/N substitution reconstructs near-$E_F$ states via dopant $π$ hybridization, and B-N pairing stabilizes defects through donor-acceptor compensation, with the ortho substitutions being the most favorable. Hydrogen adsorption remains weak on pristine lattices but becomes locally optimized upon doping, with near thermo-neutral $ΔG_{\mathrm{ads}}$ 'hot spots' predominantly on $sp$-proximate carbon sites adjacent to the dopants. Reactive MD at 300 K further reveals an activity stability trade-off: B-N ortho in $γ$-graphyne sustains controlled hydrogen uptake without catastrophic bond scission, whereas B-N meta/para degrade, and 6,6,12-graphyne is generally more susceptible to over-hydrogenation. These results identify the B-N geometry as a key design variable for graphyne-based HER catalysts, which require both a favorable $ΔG_{\mathrm{ads}}$ and finite-temperature hydrogenation stability.

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the effect of Mg incorporation on the relative phase stability of the four primary Ga$_2$O$_3$ polymorphs using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, with the goal of rationalizing experimental observations suggesting that diffusion from MgAl$_2$O$_4$ substrates contributes to relative stabilization of the $γ$ phase. Mg incorporation is modeled up to 25% of Ga sites within supercells derived from fully relaxed unit cells of each polymorph. Our results show that while $β$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ remains the thermodynamically most stable phase, the enthalpic differences between polymorphs decrease with increasing Mg content. The inherently disordered $γ$ phase, with its high configurational entropy, becomes less energetically unfavorable under Mg substitution, suggesting that entropy-driven stabilization may facilitate its formation under high-temperature and/or nonequilibrium growth conditions such as those previously reported. These findings provide a thermodynamic rationale for the experimental observation of the $γ$ phase during epitaxial growth on MgAl$_2$O$_4$ spinel substrates.

Abstract: The ab-initio thermodynamic properties of simple cubic polonium (α-Po) were studied within the quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA), where both lattice vibrations (phonons) and electronic excitations contributions are included in the Helmholtz free energy. We investigate the influence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) by comparing the scalar relativistic (SR) and fully relativistic (FR) pseudopotentials on the thermodynamic properties of polonium and evaluate the performance of three popular exchange-correlation functionals, GGA (PBE and PBEsol), and LDA (PZ). Temperature and pressure-dependent thermodynamic properties were compared with the available experimental and theoretical studies. We found that the effect of electronic excitations is negligible for all the thermodynamic properties. LDA+SOC provides a better agreement with the experimental volume, while the thermal expansion coefficients from LDA+SOC and PBEsol + SOC closely match experimental values. SOC effects appear insignificant for the isobaric heat capacity but substantially contribute to the adiabatic bulk modulus. The phonon dispersions and mode-Grüneisen parameters (γ_qη) were interpolated at the lattice constant corresponding to 301 K. The SR dispersions exhibit several anomalies in all directions, which were suppressed significantly by the inclusion of SOC. The role of SOC on the elastic constant-coefficient (C_ij) and elastic anisotropy factor at 0 K is also studied. The Pugh ratio confirmed that simple cubic polonium is ductile, and we observed that the elastic anisotropy factor and Pugh ratio decreased with increasing pressure. The effect of SOC on the Cauchy pressure is also determined.

Abstract: The slip behavior of dislocations and grain boundaries critically governs recrystallization and plastic deformation in Mg alloys and can be strongly influenced by solutes. However, the quantitative effects of solute distribution on defect mobility remain unclear. Using molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations, we systematically investigate how Al and Ca solutes affect the motion of dislocations, low-angle grain boundaries (LAGBs), and high-angle grain boundaries (HAGBs) in Mg. Within the idealized framework of random solid-solution, solute drag is dominated by elastic interactions arising from atomic size mismatch, resulting in a stronger resistance from Ca than from Al. In contrast, under the more realistic condition where solute segregation occurs, the dominant mechanism shifts to chemically driven pinning, whose effectiveness is governed by the attainable segregation density. Owing to strong Ca-Ca repulsion, Al achieves substantially higher segregation concentrations than Ca and therefore exerts much stronger pinning effects. Notably, solute-induced retardation is significantly more pronounced for HAGBs than for LAGBs, leading to amplified solute effects during the late stages of recrystallization, where grain growth is controlled primarily by HAGB migration. These results provide atomic-scale insight into experimentally observed grain refinement in Mg alloys.

Abstract: Grain boundary (GB) migration accompanied by Cr depletion is widely observed in Alloy 690 and is closely linked to intergranular degradation and stress corrosion cracking. However, the fundamental driving force for GB migration and its link with Cr depletion remains unclear. In this work, hybrid molecular dynamics and semi-grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations were employed to investigate GB migration in Alloy 690 under coupled solute diffusion and segregation effects across a range of GB characters. The results show that Cr segregation at GBs, while generally considered favorable for GB stability, can facilitate diffusion-induced GB migration and Cr depletion. Cr diffusion along GBs produces localized Cr depletion zones that are energetically incompatible with positively segregating GBs, generating a chemical driving force that drives GB migration toward the Cr-rich matrix, which ultimately results in persistent GB migration accompanied by a Cr depletion. By quantifying solute-GB interaction energetics, we demonstrate that GB migration is quantitively controlled by the coupled effects of solute diffusivity and segregation strength. These mechanistic insights provide a unified framework that rationalizes experimentally observed correlations between GB character, Cr depletion, and GB migration in Cr-containing alloys.

Abstract: A polymorph of the bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7 that displays an alternating single-layer (SL) and trilayer (TL; 1313) stacking pattern has recently been discovered. Signatures of superconductivity under pressure have been found in this phase. At ambient pressure, La3Ni2O7-1313 has been reported to crystallize in three different space-group symmetries Cmmm, Imma, and Fmmm. Unlike the commonly observed tilted NiO6 octahedra in perovskite nickelates, the Cmmm phase exhibits no NiO6 tilts, implying that this structural feature alone may be insufficient to give rise to superconductivity in Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates. Here, we employ first-principles calculations and group theory analysis to study the pressure dependence of the structural instabilities in this SL-TL La3Ni2O7 polymorph. At ambient pressure, we identify multiple unstable phonon branches in the highest symmetry (Cmmm) structure at various high-symmetry points of the Brillouin zone. Distortions associated with these instabilities lead to one of the other experimentally reported space groups (Imma) that does display octahedral tilts. The magnetic tendencies indicate that the electronic structure of La3Ni2O7-1313 at ambient pressure is dominated by the TL block, as the SL is in a Mott-insulating regime. Under pressure, a tetragonal P4/mmm structure becomes stable, in agreement with experiments.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We propose a framework for generating magnetic structures, inspired by the concept of oriented spin space groups (SSGs): magnetic structures are first generated as totally symmetric representations of an SSG and are then rotated such that they belong to the maximal magnetic space group of the SSG, which we term spin-symmetry-adapted (SSA) structures and oriented SSA structures, respectively. This is a natural framework to enforce fixed magnetic moment magnitudes on the symmetry-equivalent sites as well as to exploit the spin-orbit coupling (SOC)-induced hierarchy of energy scales. To examine the present scheme, we analyze the MAGNDATA database and find that 77% of the reported structures are reproducible at the SSG level, among which 82% are fully reproduced within the oriented SSG scheme, regardless of their spin-only group types or propagation vectors. To quantitatively assess computational and predictive performance, we perform spin density functional theory calculations for 283 materials, first carrying out self-consistent calculations for SSA structures without SOC, followed by fixed-charge calculations including SOC for the descendant oriented SSA structures. The experimental magnetic structures are reproduced as energetically most stable in 82% of cases at the SSG level without SOC and in 76% of cases at the oriented SSG level with SOC, showing that the fixed-charge scheme enables accurate evaluation of SOC-induced energy differences at low computational cost. The characteristic energy scale among oriented SSA structures is only $\sim$0.29 meV per magnetic atom, about 300 times smaller than that of distinct SSA structures. These results demonstrate that oriented SSG-based enumeration, combined with the two-step calculations for SSA and oriented SSA structures, provides an efficient and robust route for large-scale magnetic-structure prediction.

Abstract: Under mild mechanical pressure, halide perovskites show enhanced optoelectronic properties. However, these improvements are reversible upon decompression, and permanent enhancements have yet to be realized. Here, we report antisolvent-assisted solvent acidolysis crystallization that enables us to prepare methylammonium lead bromide single crystals showing intense emission at all four edges under ultraviolet light excitation. We study structural variations, edge-vs-center, in these crystals using micro-X-ray diffraction and find that the enhanced emission at the edges correlates with lattice compression compared to in the central areas. Time-resolved photoluminescence measurements show much longer-lived photogenerated carriers at the compressed edges, with radiative component lifetimes of ca. 1.4 us, 10 times longer than at the central regions. The properties of the edges are exploited to fabricate planar photodetectors exhibiting detectivities of 3x10^13 Jones, compared to 5x10^12 Jones at the central regions. The enhanced lifetimes and detectivities correlate to the reduced trap state densities and the formation of shallower traps at the edges due to lattice compression.

Abstract: We propose Materealize, a multi-agent system for end-to-end inorganic materials design and synthesis that orchestrates core domain tools spanning structure generation, property prediction, synthesizability prediction, and synthesis planning within a single unified framework. Through a natural-language interface, Materealize enables non-experts to access computational materials workflows and obtain experimentally actionable outputs for material realization. Materealize provides two complementary modes. In instant mode, the system rapidly composes connected tools to solve diverse inorganic tasks-including property-conditioned synthesizable candidate design with synthesis recipes, diagnosis, and redesign of unsynthesizable structures, and synthesizable data augmentation-within a few minutes. In thinking mode, Materealize applies multi-agent debate to deliver more refined and information-rich synthesis recommendations, including reasoning- and model-driven synthesis routes and mechanistic hypotheses. The mechanistic hypotheses are validated by direct comparison with the literature for known mechanisms and further supported by physics-grounded simulations for novel synthesis pathways. By combining tool-level accuracy with reasoning-level integration, Materealize can bridge the gap between computational discovery and practical experimental realization.

Abstract: Here we report on technology developments implemented into the Graphene Flagship European project for the integration of graphene and graphene-related materials (GRMs) into energy application devices. Many of the technologies investigated so far aim at producing composite materials associating graphene or GRMs with either metal or semiconducting nanocrystals or other carbon nanostructures (e.g., CNT, graphite). These composites can be used favourably as hydrogen storage materials or solar cell absorbers. They can also provide better performing electrodes for fuel cells, batteries, or supercapacitors. For photovoltaic (PV) electrodes, where thin layers and interface engineering are required, surface technologies are preferred. We are using conventional vacuum processes to integrate graphene as well as radically new approaches based on laser irradiation strategies. For each application, the potential of implemented technologies is then presented on the basis of selected experimental and modelling results. It is shown in particular how some of these technologies can maximize the benefit taken from GRM integration. The technical challenges still to be addressed are highlighted and perspectives derived from the running works emphasized.

Abstract: Mixed ionic electronic transfer (MIET) reactions, such as the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at oxide surfaces, are of paramount importance to manifold technologically highly relevant processes and fundamental understanding must be developed to improve performance and tailor highly efficient electrodes and catalysts. Understanding such complex multi-step reactions, requires the study of kinetic processes, underlying thermodynamic properties, i.e. ionic and electronic defect concentrations and electrostatic surface effects. However conventional techniques struggle to uncover the complete picture within the same sample/measurement. Here, we overcome this limitation by introducing bias-triggered conductivity relaxation (BCR) as a novel tool to investigate MIET reactions on oxides. It is based on alternating out-of-plane coulometric titration/polarization and in-plane electrical conductivity relaxation measurements, providing simultaneous electronic, ionic and extraordinarily rich surface kinetics information. This innovative combination of electrical and chemical driving forces synergizes information depth, with enhanced time resolution, versatility and speed, yet it lifts the weaknesses of the individual approaches, while remaining cost-effective and surprisingly simple. Furthermore, BCR allows to disentangle overpotential induced electrostatic modifications of the surface kinetics in a unique manner. We showcase the advantages of BCR in this work by studying the ORR in model (La,Sr)FeO$_{3-δ}$ thin film electrodes and reporting on their thermodynamic and kinetic properties.

Abstract: Metal - organic nanocomposite thin films represent a versatile class of materials whose properties can be effectively tuned through external stimuli. In this study, Ag+C60 and Au+C60 nanocomposite thin films were briefly investigated to elucidate the effects of ion irradiation on both their morphology and electrical properties. The films were synthesized by co-deposition of noble metals and fullerenes, using ion beam sputtering of metal targets combined with simultaneous thermal evaporation of C60. The as - deposited films were characterized by ion beam analysis to determine their composition and element depth distributions. Subsequently, the samples were irradiated at room temperature with either a continuous Ar ion beam or a pulsed C ion beam, both at an energy of 20 keV and a fluence of 1 x 1015 ions/cm2. Irradiation-induced morphological changes were examined by scanning electron microscopy. While the C-irradiated films retained compact and homogeneous surface morphologies, Ar irradiation induced pronounced surface restructuring, resulting in highly corrugated and porous-like surfaces. In addition to morphology, the electrical resistance of the films was measured. The results indicate that C-irradiated samples exhibit only minor changes in resistivity, whereas Ar irradiation strongly affects the electrical properties, with the most significant impact observed for the Au+C60 system. The observed changes in electrical resistance closely correlate with the irradiation-induced surface morphology. The measurement results are briefly discussed below.

Abstract: Solid electrolytes (SEs) for sodium-based superionic conductors (NaSICON) are widely recognized for their excellent ionic conductivity and application in sodium based energy storage systems. While considerable effort has been made to develop thin electrolytes for all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) for lithium ions, only a few sodium-based SEs have been successfully fabricated as thin films. These thin films are particularly desirable for their reduced electrical resistance, which typically increases with the thickness of the SE. By reducing the thickness of the SEs to the nanometer scale, their ionic conductivity can be significantly enhanced. In this study, the NASICON composite was initially prepared in the form of pellets using the mixed oxide technique with a planetary ball mill and synthesized by the solid-state method at 1250 °C. The resulting pellets were used as sputtering targets in a low-energy ion facility to prepare continuous and uniform NASICON nanofilms. To explore the effect of ion implantation on the electrical properties of NASICON, the prepared films were bombarded with Ni ions at 1.1 MeV and varying fluences, using the Tandetron accelerator at the CANAM infrastructure (NPI Řež). The electrical properties of both the synthesized and implanted films were analyzed through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results, describing the impact of irradiation on NASICON's properties, are presented here.

Abstract: In this work, we report on the study on organic-metal hybrid systems, in particular Co-C60 fullerene thin films. This study mainly focused on the investigation of the morphological and structural evolution of the film surface after various external stimuli designed to provide energy to the system. For film growth, we adopted an innovative approach, combining ion-beam sputtering of a pure metal target with thermal evaporation of C60 in a co-deposition setup. The films underwent a series of treatments to induce modifications. Laser and ion irradiations were performed using a pulsed laser, a continuous Ar beam, and a pulsed C beam. In addition, thermal annealing in vacuum was performed to examine the long-term effects of temperature. The composition of deposited film was investigated using Ion Beam Analysis, the morphology and the structure, and the effects of treatments on the films were studied using SEM and TEM microscopies and Raman spectroscopy. Changes in electrical resistance were also measured to explore potential applications of these films after treatment.

Abstract: Altermagnetism combines fully compensated magnetic order with a magnetic symmetry that relates inequivalent spin sublattices, offering a promising, still underexplored platform for unconventional topological phases. Here we show that both isotropic tensile strain and electron localization, controlled by an effective Hubbard interaction $U_{\text{eff}}$, can act as efficient and systematic topological control parameters in the altermagnetic Weyl semimetal CrSb. While CrSb hosts Weyl fermions at equilibrium, modest tensile strain of 4-5% stabilizes additional symmetry allowed Dirac crossings and triple-point fermions, with further strain selectively favoring the triple-point phase. We propose a 3D low-energy Hamiltonian that captures the interplay between the Hubbard interaction $U$ and the sublattice symmetry of the altermagnet, giving rise to an interaction-driven Dirac crossing. Our results establish CrSb as a model altermagnet in which either strain or electron localization can selectively access and control the distinct topologies inherent to the altermagnets.

Abstract: Demand for lower computing power has rapidly increased. In this context, brain-inspired neuromorphic computing, which integrate data storage and processing, has attracted significant attention. Here, our study reveals that field effect transistors fabricated on chemical vapor deposited bilayer (2L) MoS2 films can mimic the functions of biological synapse. These devices demonstrate high level of pair pulse facilitation (PPF), short term to long term memory (STM-to-LTM) transition as well as learning-forgetting-relearning properties. Effect of light intensity, pulse number, pulse width and photon energy on the STM-to-LTM transition is studied. It has been found that the rate of depression of the memory state can be controlled using the gate bias. Electrical and optical energy consumptions per synaptic event are estimated to be as low as 280 fJ and 20 nJ, respectively. Furthermore, photocurrent in these devices is observed to increase linearly with the number of the excitation pulses. This property has been exploited to demonstrate different arithmetic operations by the device. Moreover, these devices show great potential for image recognition. Artificial neural network simulation has returned an image recognition accuracy of ~85%. All these findings show a great prospect of 2L-MoS2 for developing low power, transparent and flexible neuromorphic devices.

Abstract: The magnons in antiferromagnetic insulators (AFIs) exhibit dual chirality, each carrying opposite spin angular momentum. However, in AFIs that are protected by PT symmetry, the magnon bands remain degenerate. In this work, we introduce a new class of PT - preserving AFIs in which the giant chiral splitting of magnons can be induced and reversibly controlled by an external electric field. Unlike ordinary cases, such AFIs host a hidden dipole coupled to the antiferromagnetic order, which allows an external electric field to break the magnon sublattice symmetry and thereby largely lift the band degeneracy. Through group theory analysis, we identify the possible magnetic layer groups that support electric-field-induced magnon band splitting. Promisingly, by density-functional- theory and spin wave calculations, the magnon band splitting of Cr2CBr2 reach up to 27meV induced by an electric field of 0.2V/Å, equivalent to the 230T under a uniform magnetic field. In addition, since chiral splitting is directly coupled to the electric field, the corresponding magnon-mediated spin current can be switched by the electric field. Our Letter opens a door for developing electric-field-controlled spintronics based on the magnons.

Abstract: Combinatorial sputtering is a physical vapor deposition method that enables the high-throughput synthesis of compositionally varied thin films. Using this technique, the effects of stoichiometry on specific properties of alloy thin films with analog composition gradients can be mapped using high-throughput characterization. To obtain specific stoichiometries, such as those desired for an equiatomic, intermetallic, or doped compounds, the sputter power of each target must be simultaneously tuned to optimize the deposition rate of each component. This optimization problem increases in complexity with the number of components, which commonly leads to iterative guess-and-check processing and can limit the intrinsic high-throughput advantages of this synthesis method. To circumvent this challenge, this work introduces a composition optimization procedure that enables the facile synthesis of sputtered combinatorial films with targeted compositions. This procedure leverages the expeditious mapping of composition using wavelength dispersive x-ray fluorescence and is capable of optimizing processing for an arbitrary number of components. As a demonstration, this method is leveraged to sputter a combinatorial Cr$_{v}$Fe$_{w}$Mo$_{x}$Nb$_{y}$Ta$_{z}$ film with an equiatomic composition near the wafer center.

Abstract: We report a detailed investigation of the structural, electronic, vibrational, and dielectric properties of polycrystalline LaV$_{0.5}$Nb$_{0.5}$O$_4$ samples, prepared at two sintering temperatures (1000\degree C and 1250\degree C). The introduction of Nb$^{5+}$ at the V$^{5+}$ site leads to notable structural and vibrational changes, which can be attributed to their isoelectronic nature and the comparatively larger ionic radius of Nb$^{5+}$. The Rietveld refinement of the X-ray diffraction patterns confirms a coexistence of monoclinic ($P$2$_{1}$/$n$) and scheelite-type tetragonal ($I$4$_{1}$/$a$) phases; for example, with a fraction of 4\% and 96\% for the sample annealed at 1250\degree C. The particle morphology has altered from spherical (1000\degree C) to irregular-shaped (1250\degree C) as a result of increase in annealing temperature. The Raman spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy and X-ray Photoemission Spectroscopy have been used to understand the vibrational and electronic properties. An optical band gap of 2.7~eV for the sample sintered at 1250\degree C is calculated using Ultraviolet-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy measurements. The dielectric studies shows the higher dielectric permittivity ($ε$$_{r}$) and lower dielectric loss for the sample annealed at 1250\degree C.

Abstract: Excitons and their correlated complexes underpin the rich photophysics of quantum-confined semiconductors. Among these, biexcitons -- bound states of two electrons and two holes -- provide a sensitive probe of Coulomb correlations, exciton-exciton interactions, and the role of the dielectric environment. In Ruddlesden-Popper metal halide materials (RPMHs), strong quantum and dielectric confinement stabilize excitons with binding energies of hundreds of meV, creating an ideal platform for multi-exciton phenomena. Conventional linear spectroscopies, such as photoluminescence and transient absorption, reveal biexciton signatures but suffer from spectral congestion and reabsorption artifacts. Two-dimensional coherent spectroscopies, particularly two-quantum (2Q) multidimensional techniques, uniquely access multi-exciton coherences and provide unambiguous estimates of biexciton binding energies. This minireview surveys the spectroscopic evidence for biexcitons in RPMHs, highlights the advantages of nonlinear multidimensional approaches, and situates biexciton physics within the broader context of excitonic materials, including GaAs quantum wells, quantum dots, and transition-metal dichalcogenides. By emphasizing the interplay of exciton-exciton annihilation, excitation-induced dephasing, and biexciton formation, we argue that multidimensional coherent spectroscopy offers the most reliable pathway to disentangle many-body interactions in quantum-well derivatives of metal-halide perovskites.

Abstract: Magnetoelectric systems offer potential for device applications exploiting coupled states between electric and magnetic properties. Among magnetoelectric materials, \FNO has attracted special attention because of its pronounced dielectric signal at high magnetic transition temperatures. However, the magnetic ground state, which is essential information for understanding its unusual magnetoelectricity, remains unclarified. Here, we report a noncollinear magnetic ground state of Fe$_{4}$Nb$_{2}$O$_{9}$. To examine the magnetoelectric effect associated with sequential magnetic and structural transitions upon cooling, we conducted combined x-ray diffraction, magnetic susceptibility, magnetization, dielectric constant, and magnetodielectric experiments. Powder neutron diffraction experiments revealed a series of magnetic Bragg peaks and clear splitting of peaks via structural transition. Magnetic Rietveld refinements, combined with group theory analysis, determined a noncollinear antiferromagnetic structure including a significant $c$-axis moment component at 1.5 K. This study provides insights into the understanding of its magnetoelectric properties.

Abstract: We demonstrate widefield magnetic imaging of current flow in hydrogen terminated diamond field effect transistors (FETs) through in-substrate nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers. Hydrogen termination of the diamond surface induces a two dimensional hole gas (2DHG), while an ensemble of near surface NV centers located $ \sim 1~μm$ below the surface enables noninvasive magnetic imaging of current flow with micrometer scale spatial resolution. The FETs were electrically characterized over a range of drain source biases $V_{ds}= 0$ to $-15V$ and gate voltages,$V_{gs}= +3$ to $-9V$ followed by in situ widefield NV magnetometry during device operation. Magnetic field maps and reconstructed current density distributions directly visualize current injection at the source drain contacts and transport beneath the hBN gated channel. Magnetic field maps reveal current density variations in the channel region owing to non-uniformities or defects in the gate dielectric. In addition, we observe a pronounced enhancement of the drain current ($\sim 600-900 μA$) and a shift in the apparent threshold voltage during laser illumination, reflecting photo induced changes in channel electrostatics. By correlating gate dependent magnetic images with simultaneous electrical measurements, we directly link spatial current distributions to FET transfer characteristics, providing new insight into buried interface transport and non-uniform gating effects in the transistor channel. As the methodology is compatible with top gated FETs, it can be used to map channel current distributions with micrometer resolution in emerging channel materials, such as 2D materials and wide bandgap channels, and establish widefield NV magnetometry as a powerful platform for probing charge transport in transistors and Van der Waals dielectric heterostructures.

Abstract: We report the fabrication and operation of a source-drain-gate three-terminal field-effect electronic device with an electron mobility exceeding $40\times 10^6$ cm$^2$ / (Vs). Several devices were fabricated, with the highest achieved electron mobility obtained using a symmetrically-doped GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well forming a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) with a density of $1.47(1) \times 10^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$ and a pristine, pre-fabrication electron mobility of $44(2) \times 10^6$ cm$^2$/(\text{Vs}). To circumvent the well-known degradation of electron mobility during fabrication, devices were fabricated using a flip-chip technique where all lithographic processing steps were performed on a separate sapphire substrate. This method demonstrates the successful operation of various gate assembly designs on distinct 2DEGs without observable mobility degradation. This advance doubles the previous record for field-effect electronic device mobility and enables access to new regimes of quantum transport and applications that were previously unfathomable due to mobility limitations.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Quantum interference effects such as weak localization (WL) and universal conductance fluctuations (UCF) normally yield consistent electronic phase-coherence lengths in homogeneous conductors. Here we show that in individual carbon nanotube bundles exfoliated from highly conductive solution-spun fibers, different probes, including the field scales and magnitudes of WL and UCF and nonlocal magnetoconductance, lead to strikingly disparate estimates of coherence lengths. WL magnetoconductance measured in a perpendicular magnetic field yields a phase-coherence length of approximately 50 nm. In contrast, UCF amplitudes are comparable to e squared over h even for an 8 micrometer long segment, and nonlocal magnetoconductance persists across a 4 micrometer separation of electrodes, revealing phase-coherent transport over micrometer length scales within a single bundle. The coexistence of short- and long-range coherence implies that locally diffusive electrons remain partially phase-correlated among nanotubes within the same bundle. These findings challenge the conventional single-scale picture of mesoscopic coherence and establish carbon nanotube bundles as a model platform for emergent, network-level quantum transport.

Abstract: The valley degree of freedom in atomically thin transition-metal dichalcogenides provides a natural binary index for information processing. Exciton-polaritons formed under strong light-matter coupling offer a promising route to overcome the limited lifetime and transport of bare valley excitons. Here we report an anomalous optical valley Hall effect in a monolayer WS2 exciton-polariton system. Using polarization- and time-resolved real-space imaging, we directly visualize a symmetry-breaking spatial separation of polaritons from opposite valleys under linearly polarized excitation, accompanied by an ultrafast Hall drift velocity on the order of 10^5 m/s. This behaviour cannot be accounted for by conventional cavity-induced mechanisms and instead points to a strain-induced synthetic pseudomagnetic field acting on the excitonic component of polaritons. Our results establish exciton-polaritons as a high-speed and optically accessible platform for valley transport, opening pathways towards tunable valleytronic and topological photonic devices.

Abstract: We report an experimental study of induced superconductivity in Ge hut nanowire Josephson junctions. The Ge hut nanowires are grown on prepatterned SiGe ridges via molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and Josephson junction devices are fabricated by contacting the nanowires with Al electrodes. Low-temperature current-bias transport measurements of the Josephson junctions are performed and the measurements show that the devices exhibit gate-tunable supercurrent and excess current. The analysis of excess current indicates that the transparency of the Ge hut nanowire Josephson junctions is as high as 85%. Voltage-bias spectroscopy measurements of the devices show multiple Andreev reflections up to the fourth order. With magnetic field and temperature-dependent measurements of the multiple Andreev reflections, the critical field and the critical temperature of the induced superconductivity in the Josephson junctions are extracted to be ~0.12 T and ~1.4 K. The success in introducing superconductivity into Ge hut nanowires will stimulate their applications in building advanced quantum processors.

Abstract: Solid-state quantum emitters (QEs) in two-dimensional semiconductors offer compact, chip-compatible sources for quantum photonics. In transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), nanopillars are widely used to induce localized emission, yet the underlying confinement mechanism and the relative roles of strain versus dielectric environment remain unclear. The general problem addressed here is whether strain alone explains quantum emitter formation and placement in MoSe$_2$, or whether dielectric contrast at suspended-supported interfaces is also required. Here, we combine hyperspectral superlocalization of photoluminescence with co-registered AFM topography and phase to map the positions of localized states (LS) in MoSe$_2$ suspended on GaN pillars and correlate them with bending strain and the local dielectric context. Contrary to the common assumption of purely strain-driven activation, LS frequently occur at suspended--supported interfaces around the pillar apex and span a broad strain range without a clear threshold, while being scarce along high-strain ripples. Our data indicate that deterministic emitter positioning in Mo-based TMDs benefits from co-engineering both strain gradients and nanoscale dielectric heterogeneity, rather than strain alone. More broadly, this combined optical-mechanical characterization approach provides a general framework for mapping structure-property relationships in 2D quantum materials at the single-emitter level.

Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for non-collinear antiferromagnetic spin torque oscillators (NC-AFM STO) by unifying spin dynamics under the Poisson Bracket formalism. Shifting from traditional torque-based descriptions to an operational symmetry perspective, we develop two complementary viewpoints: a vector perspective identifying infinite degenerate Rigid Body Precession (RBP) states where exchange energy depends solely on the total magnetic momentum, and a particle perspective decomposing dynamics into Center-of-Mass (CM) translation and Relative Motion (RM) oscillation. Using time-dependent rotational and translational transformation techniques, we analytically resolve the rapid (~10 ps) transient evolution into a stable RBP state driven by SOT and damping. We demonstrate that the out-of-plane anisotropy (OPA) lifts the exchange degeneracy, triggering a long-term (~1 ns) oscillatory decay toward a steady state characterized by uniform spin z-components and a 120-degree inter-spin locking angle. This state is accurately governed by our Terminal Velocity Motion (TVM) model [arXiv:2305.14013], where exchange coupling transforms into kinetic energy with a light effective mass. The model precisely predicts SOT-driven transients, hysteretic excitation, and the dynamic phase diagram. Finally, we account for the sub-critical current regime mismatch by identifying a 'Rigid-Body Breaking' effect: a surge in effective friction caused by the self-resonance of RM variables induced by CM translation, mediated by the in-plane anisotropy (IPA).

Abstract: Graphene enables precise carrier-density control via gating, making it an ideal platform for studying electronic interactions. However, sample inhomogeneities often limit access to the low-density regimes where these interactions dominate. Enhancing carrier mobility is therefore crucial for exploring fundamental properties and developing device applications. Here, we demonstrate a significant reduction in external inhomogeneity using a double-layer graphene architecture separated by an ultra-thin hexagonal boron nitride layer. Mutual screening between the layers reduces scattering from random Coulomb potentials, resulting in a quantum mobility exceeding. Shubnikov de-Haas oscillations emerge at magnetic fields below 1 mT, while integer quantum Hall features are observed at 0.002T. Furthermore, we identify a fractional quantum Hall plateau at a filling factor of at 2T. These results demonstrate the platform's suitability for investigating strongly correlated electronic phases in graphene-based heterostructures.

Abstract: We show that a propagating Dirac electron with intrinsic spin generically carries a real--space helical conserved current, even in the absence of orbital angular momentum. Using exact Dirac eigenstates in cylindrical confinement, we demonstrate that this helical structure possesses definite handedness, persists into evanescent regions, and is characterized by a geometric helix pitch independent of the longitudinal de~Broglie wavelength. This intrinsic helical geometry enables a local geometric coupling between a propagating electron and a chiral environment, yielding chirality--dependent spin selectivity through current geometry rather than through a spin--orbit coupling term.

Abstract: Consistent with prior qualitative expectations for group IV-VI topological crystalline insulators, this work demonstrates, based on band structure and Chern number calculations, that Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$Se/(PbSe)$_{1-y}$(EuS)$_y$ quantum wells constitute a promising and viable platform for realizing a variety of quantum anomalous Hall phases. The proposed basis transformation procedure for the multiband $\mathit{k} \cdot \mathit{p}$ Hamiltonian enables the treatment of wells grown along arbitrary crystallographic directions while explicitly accounting for the anisotropy of the material's isoenergetic surfaces. Numerical studies of $\langle 111\rangle$-, $\langle 110\rangle$- and $\langle 001\rangle$-oriented quantum wells predict attainable Chern numbers with magnitudes ranging from $1$ to $4$, depending on the quantum well width, Sn content, and relative orientation of the four projected $\mathrm{L}$ valleys with respect to the growth direction. The results further indicate that appropriate strain compensation is required to achieve high-quality quantization of the Hall conductance.

Abstract: We theoretically predict that Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction can induce magnon equilibrium spin current in collinear antiferromagnets. Such a current, being a response to the effective magnon vector potential, can be considered as magnon analog of the superconducting supercurrent or the persistent current. Large amplitude of the predicted effect may compensate for the smallness of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, making the equilibrium spin currents to be experimentally observed. We suggest that external electric field can play the role of effective flux magnons interact with and propose an experiment based on the interference of magnons in the ring geometry as a verification of the concept.
