Abstract: We demonstrate a pump-probe strobe light spectroscopy for sensitive detection
of magneto-optical dynamics in the context of hybrid magnonics. The technique
uses a combinatorial microwave-optical pump-probe scheme, leveraging both the
high-energy resolution of microwaves and the high-efficiency detection using
optical photons. In contrast to conventional stroboscopy using a
continuous-wave light, we apply microwave and optical pulses with varying pulse
widths, and demonstrate magnetooptical detection of magnetization dynamics in
Y3Fe5O12 films. The detected magneto-optical signals strongly depend on the
characteristics of both the microwave and the optical pulses as well as their
relative time delays. We show that good magneto-optical sensitivity and
coherent stroboscopic character are maintained even at a microwave pump pulse
of 1.5 ns and an optical probe pulse of 80 ps, under a 7 megahertz clock rate,
corresponding to a pump-probe footprint of ~1% in one detection cycle. Our
results show that time-dependent strobe light measurement of magnetization
dynamics can be achieved in the gigahertz frequency range under a pump-probe
detection scheme.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Topological phases of matter have garnered significant interest over the past
two decades for two main reasons: their identification, via topological
invariants, relies on the quantum geometry of the Bloch states, bringing
attention to an aspect of electronic band structure overlooked up to their
discovery. Secondly, these classes of materials present electronic states with
unusual properties, leading to exotic phenomena and making them relevant for
potential applications. In this thesis we explore both fundamental and
technological aspects of the first discovered topological phase: the
topological insulator. To this end, we consider different models of topological
insulators with a particular emphasis on Bismuth compounds, evaluating their
viability for photovoltaic applications, and separately, the impact of
structural disorder on their properties.

Abstract: We demonstrate single shot al optical switching (AOS) in rare earth free
CoFeB/MgO magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs), a material system widely adopted in
spin transfer torque magnetic random access memory (STT MRAM). By tuning the
capping layer thickness, we show that precise heat control enables
deterministic magnetization reversal from parallel (P) to antiparallel (AP)
state. Furthermore, we detect magnetization reversal in a micro scale MTJ
device via the tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) effect. Our findings suggest that
ultrafast spin transport or dipolar interactions or a combination of both may
play essential roles in the switching process. This work represents a
significant step toward integrating AOS with MTJ technology.

Abstract: Strain engineering is a powerful strategy for controlling the structural and
electronic properties of two-dimensional materials, particularly in systems
hosting charge density wave (CDW) order. In this work, we apply uniaxial
tensile and compressive strain to thin 1T-TaS2 flakes using a flexible,
device-compatible platform, and systematically investigate the strain-dependent
behavior of the nearly commensurate (NC) to incommensurate (IC) CDW phase
transition. This transition is driven by Joule heating at room temperature.
Electrical transport measurements reveal that both the switching threshold
voltage and the resistance of the NC-CDW phase exhibit clear, reversible strain
dependence. Furthermore, we identify a quadratic dependence between the
strain-induced resistance change and the threshold voltage, confirming that
piezoresistive modulation governs the strain-tunability of the phase
transition. We demonstrate a room-temperature, electrically-readout strain and
displacement sensor with threshold-like response in a programmable window.
These results highlight the potential of 1T-TaS2 for on-chip sensing of strain
and displacement.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Using a two-dimensional coarse-grained chain model, planar slits in
multilayer graphite crystals are simulated. It is shown that when covering a
linear cavity on the flat surface of a graphite crystal with a multilayer
graphene sheet, an open (unfilled slit) can form only if the cavity width does
not exceed a critical value L_o (for width L>L_o, only a closed state of the
slit is formed, with the cavity space filled by the covering sheet). The
critical width of the open slit L_o increases monotonically with the number of
layers K in the covering sheet. For a single-layer cavity, there is a finite
critical value of its width L_o<3nm, while for two- and three-layer cavities,
the maximum width of the open slit increases infinitely with increasing K as a
power function K^\alpha with exponent 0<\alpha<1. Inside the crystal, two- and
three-layer slits can have stable open states at any width. For a slit with
width L>7.6nm, a stationary closed state is also possible, in which its lower
and upper surfaces adhere to each other. Simulation of thermal oscillations
showed that open states of two-layer slits with width L<15nm are always stable
against thermal oscillations, while wider slits at T>400K transition from the
open to the closed state. Open states of three-layer slits are always stable
against thermal oscillations.

Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions have been proposed as promising candidates for storing
information due to their high stability and easy manipulation by spin-polarized
currents. Here, we study how these properties are influenced by the interlayer
Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interaction (IL-DMI), which stabilizes twin-skyrmions in
magnetic bilayers. We find that the spin configuration of the twin-skyrmion
adapts to the direction of the IL-DMI by elongating or changing the helicities
in the two layers. Driving the skyrmions by spin-polarized currents in the
current-perpendicular-to-plane configuration, we observe significant changes
either in the skyrmion velocity or in the skyrmion Hall angle depending on the
current polarization. These findings unravel further prospects for skyrmion
manipulation enabled by the IL-DMI.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The electronic properties of carbon nanotubes are fundamentally governed by
their chirality, specified by the integer indices (n,m). The lack of a
predictive theory directly connecting the architecture of the nucleation cap to
the resulting (n,m) has hindered the controlled synthesis of specific
chiralities. Here, we derive a universal topological sum rule that quantifies
this relationship. We show that (n,m) is uniquely determined by the sum of the
coordinates of the six pentagons in the cap. The complete set of these
coordinates, evaluated across rotationally symmetric lattice frames, fully
defines the carbon cap structure. This rule establishes that chirality is
encoded deterministically at nucleation, as any perturbation to the pentagon
positions overwhelmingly leads to a predictable, quanti able, and entropically
irreversible shift in (n,m). We further explain the preferential formation of
the (126) nanotube by identifying a six-fold symmetric cap with epitaxial
matching to the <111> catalyst facet. Our work provides a theoretical framework
that redefines the field, shifting the focus from growth kinetics to
deterministic nucleation programming and paving the way toward predictable
synthesis.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Bernstein modes -- hybrid magnetoplasmon excitations arising from the
coupling between cyclotron motion and collective oscillations in
two-dimensional electron systems -- offer direct access to non-local
electrodynamics. These modes can exhibit rich nonlinear behavior akin to
strong-coupling phenomena in cavity quantum electrodynamics, but reaching
nonlinear regime has remained experimentally challenging. Here we report the
observation of nonlinear Bernstein modes in graphene using terahertz excitation
with near-field enhancement from embedded metallic contacts. Photoresistance
spectroscopy reveals sharp resonances at Bc/2 and Bc/3 that saturate at
radiation intensities nearly an order of magnitude lower than the cyclotron
resonance. We ascribe this to strong local heating of the electron gas due to
resonant excitation of high-amplitude Bernstein magnetoplasmons, associated
with a combination of the field-concentration effect of the near field and
plasmonic amplification that is resonantly enhanced in the region of Bernstein
gaps. Polarization-resolved measurements further confirm the near-field origin:
Bernstein resonances are insensitive to circular helicity but strongly depend
on the angle of linear polarization, in sharp contrast to the cyclotron
resonance response. Our results establish graphene as a platform for nonlinear
magnetoplasmonics, opening opportunities for strong-field manipulation of
collective electron dynamics, out-of-equilibrium electron transport, and
solid-state analogues of cavity quantum electrodynamics.

Abstract: Magnetic bimerons, similar to skyrmions, are topologically nontrivial spin
textures characterized by topological charge $Q$. Most studies so far have
focused on low-$Q$ solitons ($|Q| \leq 1$), such as skyrmions, bimerons, and
vortices. Here, we present the first calculations of the lifetimes of high-$Q$
bimerons and demonstrate that they are fundamentally more stable than high-$Q$
skyrmions over a wide range of temperature. To obtain realistic results, our
chosen system is an experimentally feasible van der Waals interface,
Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$/Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$. We show that the lifetimes of high-$Q$
(anti)bimerons can exceed the lifetime of those with $|Q|=1$ by 3 orders of
magnitude. Remarkably, this trend remains valid even when extrapolated to room
temperature (RT), as the lifetimes are dominated by entropy rather than energy
barriers. This contrasts with high-$Q$ skyrmions, whose lifetimes fall with
$|Q|$ near RT. We attribute this fundamental difference between skyrmions and
bimerons to their distinct magnetic texture symmetries, which lead to different
entropy-dominated lifetimes.

Abstract: The vibration of the mechanical nanowire coupled to photons via photon
pressure and coupled to charges via the capacity has been widely explored in
experiments in the past decades. This system is electrically neutral, thus its
coupling to the other degrees of freedom is always challenging. Here, we show
that the vibration can slightly change the nanowire length and the associated
Fermi velocity, which leads to coupling between vibration and Luttinger liquid.
We consider the transverse and longitudinal vibrations of the nanowires,
showing that the transverse vibration is much more significant than the
longitudinal vibration, which can be measured through the sizable frequency
shift. We predict an instability of the vibration induced by this coupling when
the frequency becomes negative at a critical temperature for the transverse
vibrations in nanowires with low Fermi energy, which can be reached by tuning
the chemical potential and magnetic field. The time-dependent oscillation of
the conductance, which directly measures the Luttinger parameter, can provide
evidence for this coupling. Our theory offers a new mechanism for exploring the
coupling between the vibration and the electronic excitations, which may lead
to intriguing applications in cooling and controlling the mechanical
oscillators with currents.

Abstract: The spin Seebeck effect is useful for probing the spin correlations and
magnetic order in magnetic insulators. Here, we report a strong longitudinal
spin Seebeck effect (LSSE) in antiferromagnetic V2O3 thin films. The LSSE
response at cryogenic temperatures increases as a function of the external
magnetic field until it approaches saturation. The response at given power and
field exhibits a non-monotonic temperature dependence, with a pronounced peak
that shifts toward higher temperatures as the field increases. Furthermore, the
magnitude of the LSSE signal decreases consistently with increasing thickness,
implying that the bulk SSE dominates any interfacial contribution. This
negative correlation between the SSE and the thickness implies that the magnon
energy relaxation length in V2O3 is shorter than the thickness of our thinnest
film, 50 nm, consistent with the strong spin-lattice coupling in this material.

Abstract: Mesoscopic systems possess shot noise in their currents due to the
quantization of the conducting quasiparticles. Measurements of this shot noise
are useful to study phenomena that do not manifest themselves in standard
conductance or resistance measurements, such as the statistics of the
conducting quasiparticles or quantum entanglement via Bell tests. The
corresponding particle statistics can be determined via two particle quantum
interference experiments, such as the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect which demonstrates
a bunching effect for bosons or an anti-bunching effect in fermions. In
superconducting proximity junctions, electrons incident on a superconductor can
induce holes via crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) in spatially separated normal
metal leads, where the resulting hole currents have nontrivial partition noise
due to the four terminal configuration. These nonlocally generated currents,
using a superconductor as a mesoscopic beam splitter, enable fabrication of
mesoscopic analogs to quantum optics interferometers using metallic and
superconducting films with multiport geometries.

Abstract: Optical gain is a critical process in today's semiconductor technology and it
is most often achieved via stimulated emission. In this theoretical study, we
find a resonant TE mode in biased low-symmetry two-dimensional metallic systems
which may lead to optical gain in the absence of stimulated emission. We do so
by first modeling the optical conductivity using Boltzmann non-equilibrium
transport theory and then simulating the scattering problem using a
scattered-wave formalism. Assuming that the system may possess a Berry
curvature dipole (BCD) and a non-zero Magnetoelectric tensor (MET), we find
that the optical conductivity has a non-trivial dependence on the direction of
the applied bias, which allows for probing the TE mode. After analyzing the
system with one of each of the effects, we find that the resonant TE mode is
only accessible when both effects are present. Further studies are necessary to
find materials with a suitably large BCD and MET, in order to realize the
predictions within this study.

Abstract: A common method for reading out the state of a spin qubit is by latching one
logical qubit state, either $|1\rangle$ or $|0\rangle$, onto a different,
metastable charge state. Such a latched state can provide a superior charge
sensing signal for qubit readout, and it can have a lifetime chosen to be long
enough that the charge sensed readout can be high fidelity. However, the
passive reset out of latched states is inherently long, which is not desirable.
In this work, we demonstrate an on-demand, high fidelity (> 99%)
re-initialization of a quantum dot qubit out of a latched readout state. The
method is simple to apply as it involves a single baseband voltage pulse to a
specific region in the quantum dot stability diagram where the relaxation time
from the latched state to the ground state is over 50 times faster. We describe
the mechanism for the reset process as well as the boundaries for the optimal
reset region in the qubit gate voltage space.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Understanding the pairing mechanism of unconventional superconductors remains
a core challenge in condensed matter physics, particularly the ongoing debate
over whether the related effects caused by electron-electron interactions unify
various unconventional superconductors (UcSs). To address this challenge, it is
necessary to establish a universal quantitative relationship for the
superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$), which can be directly obtained
from experiments and correlated with microscopic parameters of different
material systems. In this work, we establish a relation: $N_{\text{CP}}\cdot
k_{B}T_{c}^\star = \alpha\cdot U $, where $\alpha = 1/(16\pi)$ is a universal
constant, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T_{c}^\star$ is the maximal
$T_{c}$, $U$ is the on-site Coulomb interaction, and
$N_{\text{CP}}$($\propto(\xi_0/a)^D$) quantifies the spatial extent of Cooper
pairs ($\xi_0$) relative to lattice parameter ($a$) in $D$ dimensions. The
validity of this scaling relationship is empirically demonstrated, across a
four order-of-magnitude $T_c^\star$ range (0.08--133 K), by database from 173
different compounds spanning 13 different UcS families in over 500 experiments.
The fact that the unified relationship is satisfied by different materials of
different UcS families reveals that they may share superconducting mechanisms.
In addition, the scaling relationship indicates the existence of a maximum
$T_{c}^\star$ determined by the minimum $N_{\text{CP}}$, providing a benchmark
for theoretical and experimental exploration of high-temperature
superconductivity.

Abstract: The exceptional tunability of two-dimensional van der Waals materials offers
unique opportunities for exploring novel superconducting phases. However, in
such systems, the measurement of superfluid phase stiffness, a fundamental
property of a superconductor, is challenging because of the mesoscopic sample
size. Here, we introduce a contact-free technique for probing the
electrodynamic response, and thereby the phase stiffness, of atomically thin
superconductors using on-chip superconducting microwave resonators. We
demonstrate this technique on 4Hb-TaS$_2$, a van der Waals superconductor whose
gap structure under broken mirror symmetry is under debate. In our cleanest
few-layer device, we observe a superconducting critical temperature comparable
to that of the bulk. The temperature evolution of the phase stiffness features
nodeless behavior in the presence of broken mirror symmetry, inconsistent with
the scenario of nodal surface superconductivity. With minimal fabrication
requirements, our technique enables microwave measurements across wide ranges
of two-dimensional superconductors.

Abstract: Superconducting qubits have motivated the exploration of Josephson-junction
technologies beyond quantum computing, with emerging applications in low-energy
photon and phonon detection for astrophysics and dark matter searches.
Achieving sensitivity at the THz (meV) scale requires materials with smaller
superconducting gaps than those of conventional aluminum or niobium-based
devices. Here, we report the fabrication and characterization of hafnium
(Hf)-based Josephson junctions (Hf-HfOx-Hf), demonstrating Hf as a promising
low-Tc material platform for ultra-low threshold single THz photon and
single-phonon detection. Structural and chemical analyses reveal crystalline
films and well-defined oxide barriers, while electrical transport measurements
at both room and cryogenic temperatures exhibit clear Josephson behavior,
enabling extraction of key junction parameters such as critical current,
superconducting gap and normal-state resistance. This work presents the first
comprehensive study of Hf-based junctions and their potential for
next-generation superconducting detectors and qubit architectures leveraging
low superconducting gap energies.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We demonstrate that frustrated spin textures can generate anisotropic
Josephson couplings between $d$-vectors that can stabilize spatially varying
pairing orders in spin triplet superconductors. These couplings depend on the
relative orientation of $d$-vectors, analogous to Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and
$\Gamma$-type interactions in magnetism, leading to an effective "pliability"
of the pairing order that competes with superfluid stiffness. Such couplings
cannot originate from spin-orbit coupling; rather, they can arise, for example,
when itinerant electrons are coupled to a local exchange field composed of
frustrated spin moments. Using a $T$-matrix expansion, we show that coupling to
a local exchange field leads to an effective tunneling of itinerant electrons
that is dependent on the underlying spin configurations at the barrier between
superconducting grains. Furthermore, Josephson tunneling through frustrated
spin textures can produce a Josephson diode effect. The diode effect originates
either from nonvanishing spin chirality in the barrier, or from antisymmetric
Josephson coupling between noncollinear $d$-vectors, both of which break
inversion and time-reversal symmetries.

Abstract: We summarize key experimental studies of the low energy properties of
overdoped cuprate high temperature superconductors and conclude that a
theoretical understanding of the "essential physics" is achievable in terms of
a conventional Fermi-liquid treatment of the normal state, and a BCS mean-field
treatment of the (d-wave) superconducting state. For this perspective to be
consistent, it is necessary to posit that there is a crossover from a strongly
correlated underdoped regime (where a different theoretical perspective is
necessary) to the more weakly correlated overdoped regime. It is also necessary
to argue that the various observed features of the overdoped materials that are
inconsistent with this perspective can be attributed to the expected effects of
the intrinsic disorder associated with most of the materials being solid state
solutions (alloys). As a test of this idea, we make a series of falsifiable
predictions concerning the expected behavior of "ideal" (disorder free)
overdoped cuprates.

Abstract: Cesium based halide perovskites, such as CsPbI3 and CsSnI3, have emerged as
exceptional candidates for next generation photovoltaic and optoelectronic
technologies, but their practical application is limited by temperature
dependent phase transitions and structural instabilities. Here, we develop
machine learning interatomic potentials within the LATTE framework to simulate
these materials with near experimental accuracy at a fraction of the
computational cost compared to previous computational studies. Our molecular
dynamics simulations based on the trained MLIPs reproduce energies and forces
across multiple phases, enabling large scale simulations that capture cubic
tetragonal orthorhombic transitions, lattice parameters, and octahedral tilting
with unprecedented resolution. We find that Pb based perovskites exhibit larger
octahedral tilts and higher phase transition temperatures than Sn based
analogues, reflecting stronger bonding and enhanced structural stability,
whereas Sn based perovskites display reduced tilts and lower barriers,
suggesting tunability through compositional or interface engineering. Beyond
these systems, our work demonstrates that MLIPs can bridge first principles
accuracy with simulation efficiency, providing a robust framework for exploring
phase stability, anharmonicity, and rational design in next generation halide
perovskites.

Abstract: Better wall plug efficiency of deep-ultraviolet light emitting diodes
(DUV-LEDs) requires simultaneous low resistivity p-type and n-type contacts,
which is a challenging problem. In this study, the co-optimization of p-InGaN
and n- AlGaN contacts for DUV LEDs are investigated. We find that using a thin
7%InGaN cap is effective in achieving ohmic p-contacts with specific contact
resistivity of 3.10x10^{-5} Ohm.cm^2. Upon monolithic integration of p- and n-
contacts for DUV LEDs, we find that the high temperature annealing of 800C
required for the formation of low resistance contacts to n-AlGaN severely
degrades the p-InGaN layer, thereby reducing the hole concentration and
increasing the specific contact resistivity to 9.72x10^{-4} Ohm.cm^2.
Depositing a SiO2 cap by plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PE-ALD) prior
to high temperature n-contact annealing restores the low p-contact resistivity,
enabling simultaneous low-resistance p- and n-contacts. DUV-LEDs emitting at
268 nm fabricated with the SiO2 capping technique exhibit a 3.5 V reduction in
operating voltage at a current level of 400 A/cm^2 and a decrease in
differential ON-resistance from 6.4 mOhm.cm^2 to 4.5 mOhm.cm^2. This study
highlights a scalable route to high-performance, high-Al-content bipolar AlGaN
devices.

Abstract: KTaO$_3$ (KTO) is an incipient ferroelectric, characterized by a softening of
the lowest transverse optical (TO) mode with decreasing temperature. Cooper
pairing in the recently discovered KTO-based heterostructures has been proposed
to be mediated by the soft TO mode. Here we study the electron coupling to the
zone-center odd-parity modes of bulk KTO by means of relativistic Density
Functional Perturbation Theory (DFPT). The coupling to the soft TO mode is by
far the largest, with comparable contributions from both intraband and
interband processes. Remarkably, we find that for this mode,
spin-non-conserving matrix elements are particularly relevant. We develop a
three-band microscopic model with spin-orbit coupled $t_{2g}$ orbitals that
reproduces the main features of the ab initio results. For the highest energy
band, the coupling can be understood as a "dynamical" isotropic Rashba effect.
In contrast, for the two lowest bands, the Rashba-like coupling becomes
strongly anisotropic. The DFPT protocol implemented here enables the
calculation of the full electron-phonon coupling matrix projected onto any mode
of interest, and it is easily applicable to other systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: When two-dimensional atomic layers of different materials are brought into
close proximity to form van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures, interactions
between adjacent layers significantly influence their physicochemical
properties. These effects seem particularly pronounced when the interface
exhibits local order and near-perfect structural alignment, leading to the
emergence of Moir\'e patterns. Using quantum mechanical density functional
theory calculations, we propose a prototypical bilayer heterostructure composed
of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and silicon carbide (SiC), characterized by a
lattice mismatch of 18.77\% between their primitive unit cells. We find that
the removal of boron atoms from specific lattice sites can convert the
interlayer interaction from weak vdW coupling to robust localized
silicon-nitrogen covalent bonding. Motivated by this, we study the binding of
transition-metal adatoms and formulate design guidelines to enhance surface
reactivity, thereby enabling the controlled isolation of single-metal atoms.
Our machine-learning-assisted molecular dynamics simulations confirm both
dynamical stability and metal anchoring feasibility at finite temperatures. Our
results suggest the hBN/SiC heterostructure as a versatile platform for
atomically precise transition-metal functionalization, having potential for
next-generation catalytic energy-conversion technologies.

Abstract: Achieving damage tolerance in composite materials remains a central challenge
in materials science. Conventional strategies often rely on filler
incorporation or chemical modification, which can limit energy dissipation and
constrain structural stability. Here, we leverage the unique morphology of
Spirulina trichomes to investigate a reinforcement mechanism based on physical
filament entanglement. By comparing helical trichomes with their
morphologically straightened counterparts, we isolate filament geometry as the
key parameter governing mechanical performance. Trichome-based suspensions
exhibit enhanced viscoelastic response and a threefold increase in yield
stress. When processed via extrusion-based 3D printing using hydroxyethyl
cellulose (HEC) as a matrix, entangled trichomes yield a 290% improvement in
bending strength and a 15-fold enhancement in work of fracture. Fracture
surface analysis reveals a transition from interfacial debonding and pull-out
(in filaments) to crack propagation through the entangled network, indicating
structure-mediated toughening. These findings establish trichome entanglement
as a scalable, physically driven mechanism for enhancing damage tolerance
through microstructural architecture.

Abstract: Ultrawide bandgap (UWBG) semiconductors exhibit exceptional electrical and
thermal properties, offering strong potential for high power and high frequency
electronics. However, efficient doping in UWBG materials is typically limited
to either n type or p type, constraining their application to unipolar devices.
The realization of pn junctions through heterogeneous integration of
complementary UWBG or WBG semiconductors is hindered by lattice mismatch and
thermal expansion differences. Here, we report the preliminary demonstration of
diamond GaN heterojunction pn diodes fabricated via grafting. A single
crystalline p plus diamond nanomembrane was integrated onto an epitaxially
grown c plane n plus GaN substrate with an ultrathin ALD Al2O3 interlayer. The
resulting diodes exhibit an ideality factor of 1.55 and a rectification ratio
of over 1e4. Structural and interfacial properties were examined by AFM, XRD,
Raman, and STEM, providing critical insights to guide further optimization of
diamond GaN pn heterojunction devices.

Abstract: Recent experiments have shown that chemical ordering in NiCr alloys can
significantly accelerate corrosion in molten salt environments. However, the
underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using reactive molecular
dynamics and first-principles calculations, we show that long-range ordered
Ni$_2$Cr in Ni-33at.%Cr alloys corrodes far more rapidly in FLiNaK salt at
800{\deg}C than short-range ordered or random solid solutions. This accelerated
attack originates from percolating Cr pathways that enhance near-surface
diffusion and a lowered energetic barrier for Cr dissolution, as confirmed by
first-principles calculations. Contrary to earlier explanations that attributed
this behavior to residual stresses, our stress-free simulations demonstrate
that ordering alone accelerates the degradation. These results establish
percolation as a critical link between chemical ordering and corrosion
kinetics, offering a mechanistic basis for experimental observations.

Abstract: We report the discovery of a geometric pathway for tuning ferroelectric
properties through thermally driven reconfiguration between coexisting polar
states in Li-substituted NaNbO3. Using first-principles density functional
theory calculation and 7Li solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy
measurement, we reveal that Li substitution creates two distinct polar
configurations whose transformation under annealing enhances the Curie
temperature and induces piezoelectric hardening. Our findings establish a
geometrically-driven polar state reconfiguration mechanism, providing a general
design principle for ferroics whereby macroscopic functional properties can be
engineered via lattice geometry.

Abstract: Single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) exhibit remarkable optical and
electrical properties making them one of the most promising materials for next
generation electronic and optoelectronic devices. Their electronic properties
strongly depend on their chirality, i.e., their structural configuration, as
well as on the presence and nature of atomic defects. Currently, the lack of
versatile and efficient structural characterization techniques limits SWCNT
applications. Here, we report how four-dimensional scanning transmission
electron microscopy (4D-STEM) can address critical challenges in SWCNT
structural analysis. Using modern fast pixelated electron detectors, we were
able to acquire rapidly a large number of low noise electron diffraction
patterns of SWCNTs. The resulting 4D-STEM data allow to precisely determine the
local chirality of multiple nanotubes at once, with limited electron dose (down
to 1750 e-/{\AA}^2) and nanometric spatial resolution (down to 3.1 nm). We also
show how this approach enables to track the chirality along a single nanotube,
while giving access to the strain distribution. Then, we report how 4D-STEM
data enable to reconstruct high-resolution images with electron ptychography.
With this second approach, structural information can be obtained with atomic
scale spatial resolution allowing atomic defect imaging. Finally, we
investigate how multi-slice electron ptychography could provide even further
insight on nanotube defect structures thanks to its close to 3D imaging
capabilities at atomic resolution.

Abstract: In the quest of green energy, Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC) have drawn
considerable attention for chemical-to-electric energy conversion. In the
present paper, we report an enhancement of ionic conductivity in Cu2P2-xVxO7 by
vanadium substitution. The electrical (dc and ac conductivity, diffusivity,
hopping rate, electric modulus and dielectric properties) and crystal
structural properties of Cu2P2-xVxO7 (x = 0, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1) are
investigated by impedance spectroscopy and neutron diffraction, respectively.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) study confirms the presence of Cu2+,
P5+and V5+ mono-valence states. The dc conductivity results reveal a two orders
of magnitude enhancement of ionic conductivity from ~3.81x10-5 S cm-1 for x =0
to ~2.08x10-3 S cm-1 for x =1 at 993 K, revealing a possible application in
SOFCs. DC transport number studies reveal that the total conductivity is
dominated by ionic conduction (> 95%). In addition, the diffusivity and hopping
rate of oxide ions increase with increasing x. Besides, ac conductivity,
electric modulus and dielectric properties have been investigated to illustrate
the microscopic conduction mechanism. The derived results suggest that the
mechanism for ionic conduction is the correlated barrier hopping (CBH) process.
The soft-bond valence sum (BVS) analysis of the neutron diffraction patterns
reveals the three-dimensional (3D) oxide ion conduction pathways within the
crystal structure. The present study provides a pathway to enhance the ionic
conductivity, as well as understanding of microscopic conduction mechanism,
ionic conduction pathways and the role of crystal structure on the ionic
conduction.

Abstract: The search for non-toxic lead-free halide perovskites that can compete with
the lead-based counterparts has led to the emergence of double perovskites as
potential candidates. Among many options, Cs2AgBiBr6 stands out as one of the
most suitable eco-friendly materials for numerous optoelectronic applications.
In this study, quasi-2D Cs2AgBiBr6 nanosheets (NSs) were prepared via the
low-temperature injection colloidal synthesis and used to fabricate
high-performance photodetectors in a transport-layer-free architecture. The
reaction temperature and ligands played vital roles in the structural purity,
shape, and size of the synthesized Cs2AgBiBr6 NSs. The fabricated NSs disclosed
lateral sizes of up to 1.4 um and are only a few nanometers thick. The
high-performance photodetectors fabricated using the Cs2AgBiBr6 NSs yielded a
high detectivity (D) of 1.15*10^12 Jones, responsivity (R) of 121 mA/W, a
notable on/off ratio of 2.39*10^4, and a fast rise and decay time of 857 and
829 us, respectively. The device demonstrates remarkable stability. Basically,
it sustains its entire photocurrent after storage in ambient conditions for 80
days. This work showcases a pathway for the colloidal synthesis of quasi-2D
Cs2AgBiBr6 lead-free double perovskite NSs with suitable properties for
high-performance photodetection and other optoelectronic applications.

Abstract: To elucidate low-frequency vibrational modes that modulate intramolecular

donor-pi-acceptor derivative using transmission terahertz time-domain
spectroscopy (THz-TDS). The retrieved complex refractive index reveals distinct
modes at 0.62, 0.85, 1.30, 1.81, and 2.07 THz. Gas-phase density functional
theory (DFT) agrees with these features and enables assignment of specific
intramolecular motions. Together, THz-TDS and DFT identify characteristic
low-frequency modes of BCO+ and suggest their connection to ICT-relevant
nuclear motions, demonstrating that THz-TDS provides a sensitive probe of
vibrational signatures in donor-pi-acceptor systems.

Abstract: We present a revised atomistic picture of the order-disorder transition in
the archetypal orbital-ordered perovskite material, LaMnO$_{3}$. Our study uses
machine-learning-driven molecular-dynamics simulations which describe the
temperature evolution of pair distribution functions in close agreement with
experiment. We find the orbital-disordered phase in LaMnO$_{3}$ to comprise a
mixture of differing structural distortions with and without inversion
symmetry, implying a mixture of different orbital arrangements. These
distortions are highly dynamic with an estimated lifetime of $\sim 40$ fs at
1,000 K, and their fluctuations converge with the timescales of conventional
thermal motion in the high-$T$ phase - indicating that the electronic
instability responsible for static Jahn-Teller distortions at low temperature
instead drives phonon anharmonicity at high temperatures. Beyond LaMnO$_{3}$,
our work opens an avenue for studying a wider range of correlated materials.

Abstract: Simulating finite temperature phase transitions from first-principles is
computationally challenging. Recently, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
using machine-learned force fields (MLFFs) have opened a new avenue for
finite-temperature calculations with near-first-principles accuracy. Here we
use MLFFs, generated using on-the-fly training, to investigate structural phase
transitions in four of the most well-studied ferroelectric oxides; BaTiO$_3$,
PbTiO$_3$, LiNbO$_3$ and BiFeO$_3$. Only using the 0 K ground state structure
as input for the training, the resulting MLFFs can qualitatively predict all
the main structural phases and phase transitions, while the quantitative
results are sensitive to the choice of exchange correlation functional with
PBEsol found to be more robust than LDA and r$^2$SCAN. MD simulations also
reproduce the experimentally observed order-disorder character of Ti
displacements in BaTiO$_3$, the abrupt first order transitions of BiFeO$_3$ and
PbTiO$_3$, and the mixed order-disorder and displacive character of the
ferroelectric transition in LiNbO$_3$. Finally, we discuss the potential and
limitations of using MLFFs for simulating ferroelectric phase transitions.

Abstract: The performance of phosphorus-based lubricant additives is governed by their
adsorption, stability, and reactivity at the metal interface. In this study, we
investigate the adsorption behavior and tribochemical stability of three
additives: Octyl Acid Phosphate (OAP), Dibutyl Hydrogen Phosphite (DBHP), and
Amine Neutralized Acid Phosphate (ANAP). These additives are studied on iron
and hematite surfaces using both ab initio calculations and experimental
analyses on steel. Simulations revealed that ANAP exhibited the strongest
adsorption on iron, followed by DBHP, while OAP showed weaker interactions,
though its chemisorption was enhanced on hematite via hydrogen loss. Under
tribological conditions, the DBHP phosphite dissociated more readily than the
other two phosphates molecules due to its lower phosphorus coordination, as
confirmed by bond order analysis. Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM)
measurements indicated significant differences in adsorption behavior across
temperatures, with DBHP forming stable deposits, while ANAP exhibited poor
retention, in agreement with ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirmed DBHP's strong chemisorption and
molecular dissociation, leading to increased phosphorus deposition. OAP,
despite forming a phosphorus-based layer, caused a reduction in Fe oxide,
consistent with its hydrogen release mechanism observed in simulations. These
findings highlight the critical role of molecular structure and oxidation state
in tribofilm formation and stability. Understanding these interactions at the
atomic level provides valuable insights for designing high-performance
lubricant additives for extreme operating conditions.

Abstract: Hydrogen hydrates (HH) are a unique class of materials composed of hydrogen
molecules confined within crystalline water frameworks. Among their multiple
phases, the filled ice structures, particularly the cubic C2 phase, exhibit
exceptionally strong host-guest interactions due to ultra-short H2-H2O
distances and a 1:1 stoichiometry leading to two interpenetrated identical
diamond-like sublattices, one comprised of water molecules, the other of
hydrogen molecules. At high pressures, nuclear quantum effects involving both
hydrogen molecules and the water lattice become dominant, giving rise to a
dual-lattice quantum system. In this work, we explore the sequence of pressure-
and temperature-driven phase transitions in HH, focusing on the interplay
between molecular rotation, orientational ordering, lattice symmetry breaking
and hydrogen bond symmetrization. Using a combination of computational modeling
based on classical and path-integral molecular dynamics,
  quantum embedding, and high pressure experiments, including Raman
spectroscopy and synchrotron X-ray diffraction at low temperatures and high
pressures, we identify signatures of quantum-induced ordering and structural
transformations in the C2 phase. Our findings reveal that orientational
ordering in HH occurs at much lower pressures than in solid hydrogen, by
inducing structural changes in the water network and enhancing the coupling of
water and hydrogen dynamics. This work provides new insights into the quantum
behavior of hydrogen under extreme mechanochemical confinement and establishes
hydrogen-filled ices as a promising platform for the design of hydrogen-rich
quantum materials.

Abstract: Measurements of the spectral emission properties of an iron-doped
Beta-Ga2O3(010) photocathode at 300K reveal the presence of ultracold electron
emission with a 6meV mean transverse energy (MTE) in the 3.5-4.4eV photon
energy range (282-354nm). This extreme sub-thermal photoemission signal is
consistent with direct emission of electrons photoexcited from the Fe dopant
states into the low effective mass and positive electron affinity primary
conduction band, and it is superimposed on a stronger signal with a larger MTE
associated with an (optical)phonon-mediated momentum resonant Franck-Condon
(FC) emission process from a thermally populated and negative electron affinity
upper conduction band. For photon energies above 4.5eV, a transition from a
long to a short transport regime is forced by an absorption depth reduction to
below 100nm and both MTE signals exhibit spectral trends consistent with
phonon-mediated FC emission if the polaron formation self-energy is included in
the initial photoexcited electron thermalization.

Abstract: ZBLAN glass is a promising material for infrared optical fibers due to its
wide transmission window and low theoretical attenuation. However, its strong
tendency to crystallize during processing limits optical performance. While
microgravity environments have been shown to suppress crystallization, the role
of mechanical vibration under normal gravity conditions remains poorly
understood. This study systematically investigates the influence of vibration
on the crystallization behavior of ZBLAN using a controlled heating and
vibration apparatus. Samples were subjected to varied thermal and vibrational
conditions, and their crystallization onset and morphological evolution were
examined through optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy
dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Results
show that vibration reduces the crystallization onset temperature, indicating
enhanced atomic mobility and nucleation kinetics. Progressive morphological
transitions from needle-like to bow-tie and feather-like crystals were observed
with increasing temperature and vibration intensity. Surface roughness analysis
corroborates these findings, revealing a significant increase in nanoscale
roughness in crystallized regions. Although brief exposure duration and partial
thermal decoupling introduced variability among samples, the overall results
confirm that vibration acts as a direct facilitator of nucleation rather than a
purely thermal effect. This work provides new insight into vibration-induced
crystallization in fluoride glasses and establishes the experimental foundation
for follow-up modeling and apparatus optimization studies under terrestrial and
microgravity conditions.
