The mixed landscape yields directional locking at\n$\\theta_{\\rm sk}=-45^\\circ$ and flow at locked angles near the intrinsic\nskyrmion Hall angle. By mapping defect strengths, we show that weaker\nattraction lowers the depinning threshold, whereas stronger repulsion\nstabilizes and broadens the $-45^\\circ$ locking plateau. Moreover, combinations\nof attractive and repulsive defect strengths allows control of directional\nlockings and their force ranges. Defect size further tunes the response,\nselecting among $-45^\\circ$, $-50^\\circ$, $-55^\\circ$, and $\\approx-59^\\circ$.\nThese results establish mixed pinning as a practical knob to steer skyrmion\ntrajectories and the effective Hall response, providing design guidelines for\nskyrmion-based memory and logic devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Herein, we achieve ultralow\n$\\kappa_{\\mathrm{L}}$ in lightweight cyanide-bridged framework materials (CFMs)\nthrough the rational integration of properties such as the hierarchical\nvibrations exhibited in superatomic structures and rotational dynamics\nexhibited in perovskites. Unique hierarchical rotation behavior leads to\nmultiple negative peaks in Gr\\\"uneisen parameters across a wide frequency\nrange, thereby inducing pronounced negative thermal expansion and strong cubic\nanharmonicity in CFMs. Meanwhile, the synergistic effect between large\nfour-phonon scattering phase space (induced by phonon quasi-flat bands and wide\nbandgaps) and strong quartic anharmonicity (associated with rotation modes)\nleads to giant quartic anharmonic scattering rates in these materials.\nConsequently, the $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{L}}$ of these CFMs decreases by one to two\norders of magnitude compared to the known perovskites or perovskite-like\nmaterials with equivalent average atomic masses. For instance, the\nCd(CN)$_{2}$, NaB(CN)$_{4}$, LiIn(CN)$_{4}$, and AgX(CN)$_{4}$ (X = B, Al, Ga,\nIn) exhibit ultralow room-temperature $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{L}}$ values ranging from\n0.35 to 0.81 W/mK. This work not only establishes CFMs as a novel and rich\nplatform for studying extreme phonon anharmonicity, but also provides a new\nparadigm for achieving ultralow thermal conductivity in lightweight materials\nvia the conscious integration of hierarchical and rotational dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
