Abstract: Quartz tuning fork-based atomic force microscopy (QTF-AFM) has become a powerful tool for high-resolution imaging of both conductive and insulating samples, including semiconductor structures and metal-coated surfaces as well as soft matter under ambient conditions, while also enabling measurements in more demanding environments including ultrahigh vacuum and cryogenic conditions where conventional cantilever-based AFM often encounters limitations. However, the broader adoption of QTF-AFM has been constrained by the difficulty of attaching a cantilever tip to a quartz tuning fork (QTF) with the positional and angular precision required for repeatable and reproducible probe fabrication. For stable operation, the tip must be placed precisely at the midline of a single tine, aligned parallel to the prong axis, and rigidly secured. Even slight lateral offsets or angular deviations disrupt the intrinsic antisymmetric flexural mode, induce torsional coupling, and ultimately lead to systematic image distortions and reduced measurement integrity. In this work, we present a comprehensive, semi-automated QTF-tip fabrication system that integrates precision alignment, real-time frequency-sweep monitoring, and controlled Q-factor tuning within a single workflow. Experimental characterization demonstrates consistent probe preparation across multiple trials, preservation of sharp and well-defined resonance responses with deliberately adjustable damping, and high-fidelity, high-resolution imaging in practical scanning tests. This integrated approach provides a reproducible framework to QTF-based probe fabrication, lowering the technical barrier to QTF-AFM implementation and broadening its applicability across diverse sample types and operating environments.

Abstract: Non-volatile Neuromorphic Computing (NC) elements utilizing Spin Orbit Torque (SOT) provide a viable solution to alleviate the memory wall bottleneck in contemporary computing systems. However, the two challenges, low SOT efficiency and the need for in plane symmetry breaking field for perpendicular magnetization switching, greatly limit its practical implementation. In this work, the enhanced SOT efficiency of Platinum (Pt) SOT layer and field free perpendicular magnetization switching are achieved by integrating thin Ruthenium Oxide (RuO2) layer in our material stack. The optimal RuO2 thickness (0.5 nm) enhances 5.2 times Damping Like (DL) SOT efficiency compared with pure SOT layer (Pt), as determined by hysteresis loop shift measurements, with a relatively low resistivity (90 micro-Ohm-cm). Moreover, we achieve 3 times reduction of critical magnetization switching current density compared to reference sample. Our experimental findings also demonstrate Rashba-induced substantial field-free magnetization switching in the presence of an emergent built-in interfacial field. Notably, reliable multi resistance synaptic states are achieved by tailoring the synergistic effects of enhanced SOT and interfacial magnetism. The functionality of synaptic states has been further evaluated by implementing an artificial neural network and achieved image recognition accuracies of approximately 95% and 87% on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets, respectively. This systematic study paves the way to energy-efficient, field-free SOT synapses for practical NC applications.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Using the example of Ar, Kr, and Xe atoms, it is shown that graphene nanobubbles on flat substrates are multistable systems. A nanobubble can have many stable stationary states, each characterized by the number of layers, $l$, within the cluster of internal atoms. The layers are circular in shape, concentrically stacked on top of each other, forming an $l$-stepped pyramid with a flat top. The covering of this pyramid with a graphene sheet is achieved through its local stretching. The valence bonds of the sheet stretch only over the group of internal atoms; outside the coverage zone, the sheet remains undeformed and lies flush against the substrate. The maximum possible number of layers, $l_m$, increases monotonically with the number of atoms $N$ ($l_m=6$ for $N=4000$). The graphene sheet, interacting with the substrate, compresses the internal atom cluster against it, generating an internal pressure of $P\sim 1$ GPa. Numerical simulations of thermal vibrations reveal that among all $l$-layer configurations of a nanobubble, there is always one "ground"\ state. Upon heating, this ground state smoothly transitions into a layerless liquid state. All other stationary states transform into this ground state once a certain temperature is reached (for $N=4000$, the ground state corresponds to state with $l=4$). The coexistence of several stable states with different numbers of layers at low temperatures leads to the absence of a universal shape for the nanobubbles. In this scenario, the height-to-radius ratio, $H/R$, can vary from 0 to 0.24, depending on the number of layers.

Abstract: We derive a modified Lindblad equation for the state of quantum dot tunnel coupled to a Markovian lead when the spin state of the dot is driven by an oscillating magnetic field. We show that the equation is a completely positive, trace-preserving map and find the jump operators. This is a driven-dissipative regime in which coherent driving is relevant to the tunneling and cannot be treated as simply a rotation modifying the system with a bath derived under a static magnetic field. This work was motivated by an experimental desire to determine the Zeeman splitting of an electron spin on a quantum dot (a spin qubit), and in a related work we show that this splitting energy can be found by measuring the charge occupancy of the dot while sweeping the frequency of the driving field \ arXiv:2503.17481. Here we cover the full derivation of the equation and give the jump operators. These jump operators are potentially useful for describing the stochastic behavior of more complex systems with coherent driving of a spin capable of tunneling on or off of a device, such as in electron spin resonance scanning tunneling microscopy. The jump operators have the interesting feature of combining jumps of electrons onto and off of the device.

Abstract: Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are characterized by relatively large carrier effective masses and suppressed screening of the Coulomb interaction, which substantially enhances the correlation effects in these structures. The direct band gap allows to effectively optically probe these correlations. Here, we present an experimental observation of Wigner crystallization in monolayer $\mathrm{WSe}_2$ probed by the measurement of the exciton diffraction on the Wigner crystal (WC) periodic potential. We observe the formation of the WC phase in the absence of external magnetic fields at temperature range $T<26~\mathrm{K}$ and carrier concentrations $n$ $<2\times10^{11}~\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$. The direct observation of the exciton diffraction is enabled by the strong exciton longitudinal-transverse splitting induced by the long-range intervalley exchange interaction, leading to the large detuning between main exciton peak and first diffraction peak. Our findings highlight that the valley degree of freedom of charge carriers in TMDs facilitates optical probing of correlated electron phases in these structures.

Abstract: We study current flow around a circular density depletion in a two-dimensional electron gas in the presence of a strong magnetic field. The depletion is parametrized by a power-law tail with an exponent $β> 2$. We show that current and electrochemical potential are exponentially suppressed inside a surrounding area much larger than the geometric size of the depletion region. The corresponding ``no-go'' radius grows as a certain power of the magnetic field. Residual current and potential exhibit spiraling patterns inside the no-go region. Outside of it, they acquire corrections inversely proportional to the distance, which is known as the Landauer resistivity dipole. The Landauer dipole is rotated by the angle $π(1 - 1 / β)$ with respect to the direction of the average electric field. We also consider the effect of electron viscosity and show that the variation of the no-go radius with magnetic field becomes more rapid if viscosity is large enough. In that regime the size of the Landauer dipole is set by the Gurzhi length, which is much larger than the no-go radius, which is in turn much larger than the geometric size of the depletion. Our results may be useful for interpreting nanoimaging of current distribution in graphene and other two-dimensional systems.

Abstract: Energy and charge transfer between molecules and metal surfaces underpin heterogeneous catalysis, surface-enhanced spectroscopies and plasmon-driven chemistry, yet the microscopic origins of vibrational excitation at metal interfaces remain unresolved. Here we use temperature-dependent surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) to directly distinguish plasmon-vibration optomechanical coupling from hot-electron-driven excitation.By probing thionine adsorbed on gold nanostructures at 295 K and 3.5 K, we show that pronounced anti-Stokes scattering at cryogenic temperature arises from optical pumping of vibrational populations, whereas room-temperature spectra are governed by thermal population. Bromide co-adsorbates play a decisive role by guiding molecular alignment, inducing surface atom displacements, and enabling transient adsorption geometries that activate otherwise Raman-inactive vibrational modes. In the absence of bromide, distinct excitation pathways emerge, reflecting competition between optomechanical coupling and charge-transfer processes associated with molecular polarization along the optical field or orientation relative to the metal surface. These results establish molecular optomechanics as a sensitive probe of surface-molecule interactions and demonstrate how anion-mediated surface dynamics regulate energy flow at plasmonic interfaces.

Abstract: Quantum technologies aim to assemble devices whose operation is controlled by the quantum state of individual atoms. Achieving this level of control in a practical, scalable design remains, however, a major obstacle to mass societal adoption. By working at the level of interatomic bonding, molecular engineering has enabled exquisite control over the electronic properties of individual atoms and their interactions with neighboring atoms. This positions molecular electronics as a potentially disruptive quantum technology, but serious technological challenges have prevented it from being included in technical road maps. The main obstacle is that conventional, mass scalable nanodevice technologies utilize resists and solvents that can degrade molecules. Some approaches involve exposing junction interfaces to contaminants (e.g. air, resist etc...), which can be particularly problematic for spintronics. In this technical paper, we present our decade-long work into building a nanotechnological chain that can process entire metal/molecule heterostructures into vertical nanopillars electronic devices. We discuss the advantages and pitfalls of the various iterations of this process that were implemented. We also discuss outlooks for this unique technology.

Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions and related topological spin textures have emerged as a central topic in condensed-matter physics, combining fundamental significance with potential for transformative applications in spintronics, magnonics, and beyond. Over the past decade, advances in material platforms, imaging techniques, theoretical modeling, and device concepts have established skyrmionics as a rapidly expanding field. At the same time, challenges remain in stabilizing, controlling, and integrating such textures into functional architectures, while novel phenomena such as antiskyrmions, higher-order skyrmions, hopfions, and antiferromagnetic textures arise. The 2026 Skyrmionics Roadmap represents a collective effort of many authors, providing a comprehensive perspective on the current state-of-the-art and the outlook for the coming years. In 33 focused sections, each co-authored by two researchers, we chart progress in theory and modeling, material systems, skyrmion dynamics, and skyrmion technologies. By offering a consolidated vision, this Roadmap aims to guide both fundamental research and application-driven efforts, accelerating the transition of skyrmionics from conceptual breakthroughs toward practical technologies.

Abstract: Precise control and nanoscale confinement of terahertz (THz) fields are essential requirements for emerging applications in photonics, quantum technologies, wireless communications, and sensing. Here, we demonstrate a polaritonic cavity enhanced THz photoresponse in an antenna coupled device based on chemical vapor deposited (CVD) monolayer graphene. The dipole antenna lobes simultaneously serve as two gate electrodes, concentrate the impinging THz field, and efficiently launch acoustic graphene plasmons (AGPs), which drive a strong photo-thermoelectric (PTE) signal. Between 6 and 90 K, the photovoltage exhibits pronounced peaks, modulating the PTE response by up to 40\%, that we attribute to AGPs forming a Fabry Pérot THz cavity in the full or half graphene channel. Combined full wave and transport thermal simulations accurately reproduce the gate controlled plasmon wavelength, spatial absorption profile, and the resulting nonuniform electron heating responsible for the PTE response. The lateral and vertical maximum confinement factors of the AGP wavelength relative to the incident wavelength are 165 and 4000, respectively, for frequencies from 1.83 to 2.52 THz. These results demonstrate that wafer scalable CVD graphene, without hBN encapsulation, can host coherent AGP resonances and exhibit an efficient polaritonic enhanced photoresponse under appropriate gating, antenna coupling, and AGP cavity design, opening a route to scalable, polarization and frequency selective, liquid nitrogen cooled, and low power consumption THz detection platforms based on plasmon thermoelectric transduction.

Abstract: Exploiting current-induced spin-orbit torques (SOTs) to manipulate the magnetic state of dipolar-coupled nanomagnet systems with in-plane magnetic anisotropy, such as artificial spin ices, provides a route to local, electrically-programmable control of the magnetization, with relevance for applications including neuromorphic computing. Here, we demonstrate how the orientation of a nanomagnet relative to the direction of an applied electrical current impacts the threshold current density needed for all-electrical magnetization switching, and how dipolar coupling between the nanomagnets influences the switching of interacting pairs and ensembles of nanomagnets. Using a material system designed to generate SOTs in response to electrical currents, we find that the current required to switch the magnetization of isolated nanomagnets varies non-monotonically as the angle between the nanomagnet long axis and the current increases. In small artificial spin ice systems, we observe similar angular dependence of the switching current, which can be used to control the magnetization orientation of specific subsets of nanomagnets. These experimental results are supported by micromagnetic modeling, which illustrates how the various current induced torques can be exploited to control magnetization switching in nanomagnetic systems. These results establish SOT switching as a practical method for programmable manipulation of dipolar nanomagnetic systems.

Abstract: Dispersionless electronic bands lead to an extremely high density of states and suppressed kinetic energy, thereby increasing electronic correlations and instabilities that can shape emergent ordered states, such as excitonic, ferromagnetic, and superconducting phases. A flat band that extends over the entire momentum space and is well isolated from other dispersive bands is, therefore, particularly interesting. Here, the band structure of the van der Waals crystal NbOCl$_2$ is revealed by utilizing photoelectron momentum microscopy. We directly map out an electronic band that is flat throughout the entire Brillouin zone and features a width of only $\sim$100 meV. This band is well isolated from both the conduction and remote valence bands. Moreover, the quasiparticle band gap shows a high tunability upon the deposition of caesium atoms on the surface. By combining the single-particle band structure with the optical transmission spectrum, the optical gap is identified. The fully isolated flat band in a van der Waals crystal provides a qualitatively new testbed for exploring flat-band physics.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive first-principles study of twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) for a wide range of twist angles, with a focus on structural and electronic properties. By employing density functional theory (DFT) with an optimized local basis set, we simulate tBLG, obtaining fully relaxed commensurate structures for twist angles down to 0.987°. For all angles the lattice relaxation agrees well with continuum elastic models. For angles accessible to plane-wave DFT (VASP), we provide a detailed comparison with our local basis DFT (SIESTA) calculations, demonstrating excellent agreement in both the atomic and electronic structure. The dependence of the Fermi velocity and band width on the twist angle shows qualitative agreement with results from an `exact' $\mathbf{k \cdot p}$ continuum model, but reveals a small twist angle offset. Additionally, we provide details of the low-energy wavefunction character, band inversion and symmetries. Our results provide an ab initio reference point for the microscopic structure and electronic properties of tBLG which will serve as the foundation for future studies incorporating many-body effects.

Abstract: Magnetotactic bacteria synthesize linear chains of magnetite nanoparticles within their bodies, which allow the bacteria to navigate the Earth's magnetic field in search of the best habitat. Biogenic magnetite particles, called magnetosomes, are very promising for use in biomedicine. Magnetosome chains have also been found in ancient fossils and sediments. The study of magnetofossils provides valuable information about the Earth's biological past. The presence of biogenic magnetite in ancient rock samples can be detected by measuring ferromagnetic resonance spectra, first-order magnetization reversal curves, or quasi-static hysteresis loops. Theoretical analyses of these experiments generally assume that magnetosomes are spherical nanoparticles, although the shape of some types of magnetosomes is close to spheroidal one. In this work, simple formulas for describing the magneto-dipole interaction of oriented spheroids are obtained and quasi-static hysteresis loops of randomly oriented magnetosome chain assembly consisting of elongated spheroids are calculated.

Abstract: While electron-electron (e-e) interactions are known to influence resistivity in non-Galilean invariant two-dimensional (2D) systems, their effect on magnetotransport is not fully understood. Conventional models for simple bands often predict a vanishing magnetoresistivity from e-e interactions alone. In this work, we investigate magnetotransport in a gapless 6.3 nm HgTe quantum well, a hybrid 2D band system that hosts coexisting holes with both linear (Dirac-like) and parabolic energy bands. Focusing on the high temperature regime where particle-particle collisions dominate scattering, we observe significant corrections to both the magnetoresistivity and the Hall effect. The high temperature transport coefficients are in good agreement with the theoretical model describing transport in massive-massless fermion mixtures governed by a frictional mechanism and intervalley scattering. Our findings provide strong experimental validation for this theoretical framework, demonstrating that collisions between particles with different dispersions are a key mechanism governing magnetotransport in hybrid band semimetals.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The photovoltaic solar cell is a mature technology, with silicon-based technologies deployed at scale, yet current technologies are limited by the Shockley-Queisser thermodynamic limit, known since the early 1960s. The single-junction non-concentrator hot carrier solar cell operating at ambient temperature - with its theoretically predicted ultimate power conversion efficiency limit of nearly 70% that is twice the Shockley-Queisser limit and is higher than what can be achieved with even n=6 multijunction solar cells - has remained an elusive yet hot research target since the early 1980s. Metal halide perovskite semiconductors were discovered in the late 1970s and photovoltaic applications have been intensively researched and developed since the early 2010s. Current technology development of perovskite solar cells is heavily motivated by their expected cheap processing costs relative to other Shockley-Queisser limited technologies. History has shown that very few absorber materials develop into viable solar cell technologies, and it has been recognized that given the declining costs of silicon-based technologies, a new material must offer potential for both lower cost and higher efficiencies than the Shockley-Queisser limit. Slow cooling of photocarriers with energy in excess of the band edges (hot carriers), which is the first prerequisite of a solar absorbing material for building a hot carrier solar cell technology, has been reported in perovskites since the 2010s. The goal of this review is to illuminate the path towards a single-junction perovskite hot carrier solar cell technology by emphasizing uncertainties in understanding slow hot carrier cooling and recommending approaches to resolve them.

Abstract: We demonstrate a thermally-activated epitaxy window for the growth of NbO at temperatures exceeding 1000 $^o$C. NbO films grown in this mode display superior structural and transport properties, which are reproducible across a window of oxygen partial pressure. Through comprehensive analysis, we propose the prototypical electrical properties of NbO, for which a consensus has not yet been made. This study unequivocally demonstrates the utility of high temperatures in the thin film synthesis of refractory metal compounds.

Abstract: We report microwave spectroscopy of $^{167}$Er$^{3+}$ doped in CaWO$_4$ which reveals the hyperfine splitting of the erbium electronic ground state ($Z_1$, $J_\mathrm{eff.}$=15/2) induced by the $I$=7/2 nuclear spin. From spectra measured below$\sim$50 mK in magnetic fields up to 200 mT, we extract spin Hamiltonian parameters including the electron $\textbf{g}$, hyperfine $\textbf{A}$, and nuclear electric quadrupolar $\textbf{Q}$ tensors. Crucially, our analysis demonstrate unambiguously, that the previously unobserved nuclear electric quadrupolar moment is essential to reproduce the experimental data. With these refined parameters, we identify zero first-order Zeeman (ZEFOZ) transitions at zero magnetic field. Extending the analysis to finite fields, we uncover that ZEFOZ points lie either along the $c$ axis or within the $a$-$b$ plane. These results establish CaWO$_4$ as a promising host for long lifetime quantum memories.

Abstract: We report first-principles calculations of the electronic structure, magnon excitations, and phonons in magnetite (Fe$_3$O$_4$), jacobsite (MnFe$_2$O$_4$), and mixed manganese-zinc ferrites (Mn$_{x}$,Zn$_{1-x}$)Fe$_2$O$_4$ for representative compositions ($0\le x \le 1$) and A/B-site cation arrangements.

A classical Heisenberg spin Hamiltonian is parameterized by mapping DFT+U+J total energies for multiple collinear spin configurations onto nearest-neighbor exchange couplings, which are then used to obtain magnon dispersions and magnon densities of states within linear spin-wave theory. Phonon spectra and densities of states are obtained from finite-displacement force constants and dynamical matrices computed on the same DFT+U+J-relaxed structures. Overall, the workflow provides a consistent, composition- and configuration-aware route to electronic, vibrational, and magnetic excitation spectra across the Mn/Zn ferrite space.

Abstract: Lead-free perovskites have emerged as environmentally benign alternatives to lead-halide counterparts for optoelectronics. Among them, the double perovskite Cs2AgInCl6 family exhibits remarkable white-light emission with proper composition engineering, enabled by strong electron-phonon coupling and the formation of self-trapped excitons (STEs). Despite these advantages, the fundamental photo- and structural dynamics governing their excited-state behavior remain poorly understood. Here, we report a long-lived metastable phase in the Cs2AgInCl6 double perovskite family and unravel this process and the concomitant electronic and structural evolution using a suite of tools including transient optical spectroscopy, time-resolved X-ray diffraction (TR-XRD) and X-ray absorption (TR-XAS). We show that the photoinduced, transient metastable phase is associated with B-site (Ag-In) disorder, which induces a dramatically reduced optical bandgap. Supported by TR-XRD and first-principles calculations, the Ag-In disorder drives the formation of Ag-rich and In-rich domains with millisecond lifetimes, with lifetimes increasing at lower temperatures. TR-XAS further reveals that photogenerated STEs oxidize Ag+ to Ag2+, facilitating this highly temporally asymmetric order-disorder transition. Our findings demonstrate a new mechanism, mediated by hole-localized STE formation, that enables prolongation of transient light-induced states to the multi-millisecond regime in double perovskites, opening possibilities to harvesting the functional properties of metastable phases of these materials.

Abstract: Metal-organic framework (MOF) derived materials formed through high temperature processes show great potential as catalysts. However, understanding of structure-property relationships between the initial MOF and the resulting MOF-derived catalyst is limited because the amorphous nature of the catalyst challenges standard structural characterization methods. Neural network approaches that learn interatomic potentials from density functional theory offer a promising solution. We simulated the pyrolysis of UiO-66, UiO-67 and MIP-206 using both foundational and fine-tuned machine learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs). To mimic experimental conditions, an atmosphere of CO2 and H2 was introduced and the structures were doped with 20 wt% copper to probe the effect of copper on the structural evolution of MOFs. These simulations provide atomistic insights into gas evolution, metal nanoparticle formation, and linker decomposition that were compared to available experimental data. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of MLIPs to accurately model high temperature MOF dynamics under experimentally relevant conditions and guide the design of new catalytic materials.

Abstract: Low-energy antiferromagnetic phase transitions offer an appealing platform for low-power spintronic functionalities, yet their direct electrical access in insulating antiferromagnets remains challenging, particularly in the low-field regime where subtle Neeel vector reorientations dominate. Here, we demonstrate that targeted rare-earth-site engineering enables an electrically accessible metamagnetic transition in the insulating orthoferrite Ho0.5Dy0.5FeO3. By combining the distinct spin-reorientation sequences of DyFeO3 and HoFeO3, Dy substitution stabilizes a dual spin-reorientation pathway, hosting an intermediate state with a reduced energy barrier. This low-energy antiferromagnetic state can be tuned into the weak-ferromagnetic state under low magnetic fields. The critical field decreases with increasing temperature, providing a favorable window for functional manipulation. Both longitudinal and transverse spin Hall magnetoresistance channels exhibit clear and reproducible signatures of the metamagnetic transitions. Owing to the enhanced sensitivity of the transverse channel, additional low-field features are resolved, reflecting the projection of the Neel vector onto the spin-accumulation direction. Electrical transport measurements correlate directly with the magnetically determined phase boundaries, establishing a purely electrical access to low-energy phase transitions and to illustrate a viable pathway for exploring low-power spin dynamics in insulating oxide antiferromagnets.

Abstract: Recent dielectric and magnetic studies of (Ca0.5Mn1.5)MnWO6 ceramics [A.A. Belik, Chem. Mater. 36, 7604 (2024)] have classified this material as a rare hybrid multiferroic, with both antiferromagnetic and (anti)ferroelectric ordering occurring at the same temperature of 22 K. The pronounced dielectric anomaly observed at this temperature indicated that the structural change is primarily induced by a phonon soft mode and not by a spin arrangement, as is usually the case in type II multiferroics. However, our comprehensive investigation involving new ceramic samples as well as the sample from the above-mentioned reference does not support this conclusion. Low-temperature polarization measurements revealed no evidence of either ferroelectric or antiferroelectric order in both sample series. The dielectric permittivity exhibits only a slight change at the antiferromagnetic transition, and phonon modes observed in IR and Raman spectra show no indication of a symmetry change at low temperatures. In the new samples the Neel temperature is shifted to TN = 18 K. XRD, SEM, EDS and WDS analyses confirmed the composition (Ca0.5Mn1.5)MnWO6 of both ceramics, but also indicated a small amount (percentage points) of MnO and CaO impurities in the sample from the previous publication and Mn3O4, CaWO4 secondary phases (<4%) in the new ceramics. The differences in dielectric and magnetic properties of the two samples can therefore be explained by their different chemical purity. The small dielectric anomaly of the new sample at the antiferromagnetic transition temperature is explained by a spin-phonon coupling. We conclude that (Ca0.5Mn1.5)MnWO6 is not a multiferroic, but a paraelectric antiferromagnet.

Abstract: MoS$_2$ field-effect transistors (FETs) with high-\textit{k} oxides currently lag behind silicon standards in bias and temperature stability due to ubiquitous border oxide traps that cause clockwise (CW) hysteresis in gate transfer characteristics. While suppressing this effect is typically mandatory for logic FETs, here we explore an alternative strategy where the initial CW hysteresis can be dynamically overcome by stronger counterclockwise (CCW) hysteresis towards memory-like dynamics. We systematically compare hysteresis in similar back-gated MoS$_2$/HfO$_2$ and MoS$_2$/Al$_2$O$_3$ FETs up to 275\textdegree C. At room temperature, both devices initially show sizable CW hysteresis. However, at 175\textdegree C MoS$_2$/HfO$_2$ FETs exhibit dominant CCW dynamics coupled with self-doping and negative differential resistance (NDR) effects. Our compact model suggests that this behavior is caused by the drift of mobile oxygen vacancies (\textit{V}\({}_{\mathrm{O}}^{+}\) or \textit{V}\({}_{\mathrm{O}}^{2+}\)) within HfO$_2$ which also causes negative $V_{\mathrm{th}}$ shift under a constant positive bias stress. This alternative mechanism effectively overrides the initial CW hysteresis and enables intrinsic memory functionality that can be enhanced by using narrower gate bias sweep ranges. In contrast, the MoS$_2$/Al$_2$O$_3$ FETs display only minor CCW dynamics even at 275\textdegree C due to higher drift activation energies for the same vacancies, thereby maintaining superior stability. Our results reveal an insulators selection paradigm: Al$_2$O$_3$ layers are better suited to suppress detrimental negative $V_{\mathrm{th}}$ shifts in MoS$_2$ logic FETs at high temperatures, whereas their HfO$_2$ counterparts can serve as active memory layers that would exploit these abnormal instabilities.

Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamics and phase stability of the AlTiVCr lightweight high-entropy alloy using a combination of ab initio electronic structure calculations, a concentration wave analysis, and atomistic Monte Carlo simulations. In alignment both with experimental data and with results obtained using other computational approaches, we predict a $\textrm{B2}$ (CsCl) chemical ordering emerging in this alloy at comparatively high temperatures, which is driven by Al and Ti moving to separate sublattices, while V and Cr express weaker site preferences. The impact of this $\textrm{B2}$ chemical ordering on the electronic transport properties of the alloy is investigated within a Kubo-Greenwood linear response framework and it is found that, counter-intuitively, the alloy's residual resistivity increases as the material transitions from the $\textrm{A2}$ (disordered bcc) phase to our predicted $\textrm{B2}$ (partially) ordered structure. This is understood to result primarily from a reduction in the density of electronic states at the Fermi level induced by the chemical ordering. At low temperatures, our atomistic Monte Carlo simulations then reveal subsequent sublattice orderings, with the ground-state configuration predicted to be a fully-ordered, single-phase structure with vanishing associated residual resistivity. These results give fresh, insight into the atomic-scale structure and consequent physical properties of this well-studied, technologically relevant material.

Abstract: The large - scale commercialization of promising lithium - sulfur (Li - S) batteries remains limited by the polysulfide shuttle effect, which causes rapid capacity fading and poor cycle life. In this study, we present a scalable strategy to mitigate this challenge by modifying polyethylene (PE) separators with ferromagnetic and solid - state ionic coatings. Thin films of nickel (Ni), cobalt (Co), and the Li - ion - conducting ceramic Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 (LAGP) were deposited via ion beam sputtering, while Ni ion implantation was also employed to modify the PE substrate. The electrochemical performance of pristine and modified separators was evaluated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and staircase voltammetry (SV) in liquid electrolyte within H - cell configurations. Surface morphology and elemental composition were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS). The results show that LAGP-based coatings significantly enhance separator stability and effectively suppress polysulfide diffusion, leading to lower redox peak intensities and improved cycling performance. In contrast, Ni coatings exhibited poor long - term stability, likely due to parasitic reactions or delamination during its life time. The combined LAGP/Co architecture provided the most effective suppression of the polysulfide shuttle, attributed to synergistic ionic and catalytic effects that promote interfacial stability and selective ion transport. Ni implantation into PE showed only a negligible effect. This study highlights the potential of integrating solid ionic conductors with ferromagnetic layers to design multifunctional separators for high-performance Li - S batteries.

Abstract: Understanding the coupling between lattice vibrations and magnetic order is crucial for controlling properties of two-dimensional magnetic materials. Here, we investigate the vibrational properties of bulk and thick-flake CrCl$_\textrm{3}$ using polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy, complemented by photoluminescence, photoluminescence excitation, and optical absorption measurements. Symmetry analysis, supported by first-principles phonon calculations, enables the unambiguous assignment of all eight Raman-active modes, four $\textrm{A}_\textrm{g}$ and four $\textrm{E}_\textrm{g}$, previously predicted only theoretically. Excitation-energy-dependent measurements reveal that the strong enhancement of selected phonon modes originates primarily from interference effects rather than resonant Raman scattering. Temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy further reveals pronounced signatures of spin-phonon coupling across the transition from a fully antiferromagnetic phase, through an intermediate regime with local, domain-like ferromagnetic order, to the paramagnetic phase, accompanied by a clear rhombohedral-to-monoclinic structural transition. Together, these results demonstrate how lattice, electronic, and magnetic degrees of freedom collectively govern the Raman response of CrCl$_\textrm{3}$.

Abstract: Grain boundaries can exist as different grain boundary phases (also called complexions) with individual atomic structures. The thermodynamics of these defect phases in high-angle grain boundaries were studied mostly with atomistic and phase field computer simulations, but almost exclusively for special, symmetric boundaries. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations combined with structure search methods, as well as scanning transmission electron microscopy experiments to take a step towards understanding more general grain boundaries. Using the example of $Σ$37c $[11\overline{1}]$ tilt boundaries in Cu, we show how the grain boundary phase transition on a symmetric boundary plane is changed by the geometrically necessary defects introduced in inclined, asymmetric boundaries. We analyze the disconnections - which are dislocation-like line defects of grain boundaries - both in the simulations, as well as in experimental Cu and Al samples. A main finding is that defect energies can have a major influence on the stability of grain boundary phases, even at small inclinations. Furthermore, some defects are not able to effect large inclinations. At that point, defective asymmetric GB phases compete with grain boundaries faceting into the adjacent symmetric GB phases.

Abstract: The Edelstein effect, which enables charge-to-spin conversion and is therefore highly promising for future spintronic devices, can be realized and non-volatilely manipulated in ferroelectric materials owing to their broken inversion symmetry and switchable polarization states. To date, most ferroelectric systems reported to exhibit the Edelstein effect are semiconductors, requiring extrinsic doping for functionality. In contrast, the Edelstein effect has rarely been reported in metallic ferroelectric systems, where doping is unnecessary. Using first-principles calculations, we predict that a pronounced Edelstein effect can be realized in the recently proposed intrinsic two-dimensional ferroelectric metal PtBi$_{2}$ monolayer, where the sign of the Edelstein coefficient is coupled to the direction of ferroelectric polarization through the polarization-switching-induced reversal of spin textures, thereby enabling non-volatile control of charge-spin conversion. The Edelstein effect reaches a magnitude of $10^{11}~\hbar/(\textup{A} \cdot \textup{cm})$, which is sizable compared to previously reported ferroelectric systems. Microscopically, the Edelstein effect in a PtBi$_2$ monolayer originates from competing contributions of inner Rashba-like electron pockets and outer hole pockets with opposite signs; an upward shift of the Fermi level alters their balance and can reverse the sign of the Edelstein effect. Upon applying biaxial strain, the Fermi-surface electronic structure is strongly modified, resulting in a pronounced change of the Edelstein effect: a 2 \% compressive strain suppresses the Edelstein effect by about 50 \%. Our results not only identify a promising material platform for tunable charge-spin conversion but also provide new insights into the functional potential of metallic ferroelectric systems.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive first-principles study on the origin of the piezomagnetic effect in the non-collinear antiferromagnet Mn$_3$Sn, a material known for exhibiting a large anomalous Hall effect. We investigate strain-induced variations of electronic and magnetic states and elucidate the mechanism of the piezomagnetic effect from both real-space and momentum-space perspectives. In real space, the emergence of piezomagnetism is understood to arise from rotations of the magnetic moments at specific Mn sites, which directly couple to the strain. Through detailed electronic structure analysis, we identify the Fermi surfaces that play a crucial role in the emergence of piezomagnetism. Our results reveal that specific Fermi surface features undergo pseudo-degeneracy lifting under applied strain, which significantly contributes to the induced net magnetization. By combining these complementary real-space and momentum-space pictures, our dual-space analysis provides deep insight into the microscopic origins of strain-driven magnetization in Mn$_3$Sn.

Abstract: Metal phosphosulfides have emerged as unique multifunctional materials, but they present unique synthesis challenges compared to more established material classes such as oxides and nitrides. As a consequence, experimental development and theoretical understanding of phosphosulfides have focused on individual compounds rather than on accelerated broad-range exploration. In this work, we first evaluate the synthesizability and band gaps of 909 hypothetical ternary phosphosulfides by density functional theory. We find 19 previously unknown thermodynamically stable compounds, including the first Si- and Ge-based phosphosulfides. For rapid band gap prediction, we then develop a multi-fidelity machine learning model to translate semilocal density functional theory band gaps into experimentally calibrated band gaps. Importantly, we extend the accelerated material development workflow to the experimental domain by demonstrating a route to high-throughput synthesis and characterization of virtually any phosphosulfide material system. The method is based on thin-film combinatorial libraries and yields over 100 unique compositions in each experiment, enabling us to synthesize four distinct phosphosulfide compounds in only four combinatorial experiments without prior synthesis recipes and without compromising on material quality. Thus, we argue that accelerated materials development workflows combining theory, artificial intelligence, synthesis, and characterization can be viable even for experimentally challenging inorganic materials.

Abstract: Helimagnetic materials offer a versatile platform for spin-based device concepts owing to their long-range, tunable spiral order. Here, we demonstrate controlled manipulation of the helimagnetic propagation vector q by geometrical confinement, using FeGe as a model DMI-driven chiral magnet. Micromagnetic simulations based on the nonlinear sigma model reveal that open boundaries give rise to a chiral surface twist acting as an effective surface anisotropy, which dictates the preferred helix orientation in the absence of magnetostatic shape effects. This geometry-induced anisotropy is quantitatively captured by an analytical model derived from the DMI boundary condition. Magnetic force microscopy measurements on focused-ion-beam structured FeGe confirm the predicted orientation behavior and establish geometry-controlled helimagnetic order as a robust, tunable mechanism for steering DMI-stabilized spin-spiral states. The concept provides a general route toward device-level control of chiral magnetic order in of non-centrosymmetric systems.

Abstract: By means of first-principles density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, we perform a comparative analysis of the electronic and magnetic properties of transition metal-doped TiO$_2$. The electronic band gaps of Ti$_x$M$_{1-x}$O$_2$, where M represents 3d-transition metals such as Sc, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn have been determined using the PBE functional within the generalized-gradient approximation (GGA) scheme, and also using the hybrid HSE06 functional. In the context of pure TiO$_2$, the partial density of states (PDOS) reveals that the electronic band gap emerges between the O-2p and Ti-3d orbitals. It is suggested that the Ti-3d ($t_{2g}$) states play a more prominent role in bonding compared to the Ti-3d ($e_g$) states. We performed DFT calculations to investigate the impact of doping with other 3d transition metal atoms, leading to the emergence of impurity states within the band gap. The hybridization between the oxygen 2p orbitals and the titanium 3d orbitals in TiO$_2$ is altered by the introduction of doping with 3d transition metals because of the change in the oxidation state of titanium, shifting from solely 4+ to a combination of 4+ and 3+ states. The calculation of spin-polarized density demonstrates the emergence of ferromagnetic properties, particularly in titanium dioxide doped with chromium (Cr), manganese (Mn), and iron (Fe) with large magnetic moments. Our work demonstrates the significant impact of doping transition metals on TiO$_2$, allowing for the precise manipulation of electrical and magnetic properties, and thus holds great potential for the development of spin-based memory devices with possible neuromorphic applications.

Abstract: Molybdenum disulfide (MoS$_2$) is a prototypical layered transition-metal dichalcogenide whose electrocatalytic performance is governed by a delicate balance between crystallinity, defect density, and electronic conductivity. Here we report a systematic molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) study in which annealing temperature, deposition cycle number, and Mo/S thickness ratio were independently varied to control the structural and electronic properties of MoS$_2$ thin films. The successful epitaxial growth of atomically uniform MoS$_2$ directly on Si substrates enables strong interfacial coupling and efficient charge transfer, offering a viable route toward semiconductor-integrated catalytic architectures. X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption analyses reveal that higher annealing temperatures and excessive deposition cycles enhance crystallinity but reduce edge-site density and electrical conductivity, leading to diminished hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity. In contrast, intermediate cycle numbers and sulfur-deficient growth conditions yield heterostructures composed of MoS$_2$ with residual metallic Mo and sulfur vacancies, which activate otherwise inert basal planes while providing conductive pathways. These defect-engineered films deliver the best catalytic performance, achieving overpotentials as low as -0.33 V at -10 mA cm$^{-2}$, enlarged electrochemical surface area (ECSA) up to 8.0 cm$^2$, and mass-based turnover frequencies exceeding 23 mmol H$_2$ g$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$, more than double those of stoichiometric counterparts. Our findings establish sulfur stoichiometry and growth kinetics as powerful levers to tune the interplay between structural order and catalytic activity in MBE-grown MoS$_2$ and point toward a broader strategy for engineering layered catalysts at the atomic scale.

Abstract: Despite major experimental progresses in time-resolved and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, a quantitative, microscopic framework for interpreting exciton-induced modifications of electronic band structures -- applicable even beyond the low-density limit -- is still lacking. Here we close this gap by introducing a unified approach that links the dynamics of coherent and incoherent excitons to distinct and experimentally observable excitonic sidebands. Our central result is a general, first-principles formula for time-resolved photoemission spectra, applicable across a broad range of temperatures, excitation densities, and pump-probe delays. This advance provides a predictive tool for quantitatively tracking excitonic dynamics in complex materials.

Abstract: Oxygen ion conductors are indispensable materials for such as solid oxide fuel cells, sensors, and membranes. Despite extensive research across diverse structural families, systematic data enabling comparative analysis remain scarce. Here, we present a curated dataset of oxygen ion conductors compiled from $84$ experimental reports spanning $60$ years, covering $483$ materials. Each record includes activation energy ($E_a$) and prefactor ($A$) derived from Arrhenius plots, alongside detailed metadata on structure, composition, measurement method, and data source. When the original papers derive these using an erroneous Arrhenius equation $σ_T=A\exp{\left(-\frac{E_a}{RT}\right)}$, where ($σ_T$ is the oxygen ion conductivity at temperature $T$ and $R$ is the gas constant), we replotted these using the correct one, $σ_{T}T=A\exp{\left(-\frac{E_a}{RT}\right)}$. To illustrate how the database can be used, we constructed interpretable regression models for predicting oxygen ionic conductivity. Two symbolic regression models for E_a and A suggest that oxygen ion transport is primarily governed by local coordination environment and the electrostatic interactions, respectively. This dataset establishes a reliable foundation for data-driven discovery and predictive modeling of next-generation oxygen ion conductors.

Here, focusing on the industrially important family of calcium aluminosilicate glasses, we measure the fracture toughness of two glass series using the single-edge precracked beam method, one based on tectosilicate compositions with varying silica contents and the other covering both percalcic and peraluminous compositions with varying Al/Ca ratio. To elucidate the structural origins of the variation in fracture toughness, we perform X-ray total scattering measurements and molecular dynamics simulations. Our findings show that local coordination changes of especially Al atoms, so-called bond switching, feature an overall positive correlation with fracture toughness. We also compare this variation with that in other mechanical properties, including elastic moduli, hardness, and crack initiation resistance. We find that various structural aspects need to be considered to describe and understand the mechanical properties of calcium aluminosilicate glasses.

Abstract: Magnetoelastic coupling in van der Waals (vdW) magnetic materials enables a unique interplay between the spin and lattice degrees of freedom. Characterizing the elastic responses with atomic and femtosecond resolution across the magnetic transition is essential for guiding the design of magnetically tunable actuators and strain-mediated spintronic devices. Here, ultrafast x-ray diffraction employed at a free-electron laser reveals that the atomic displacements, wave vectors, and dispersion relations of acoustic phonon modes in a vdW antiferromagnet FePS$_3$ are coupled with the magnetic order, by tracking both in-plane and out-of-plane Bragg peaks upon optical excitation across the Néel temperature (T$_N$). One transverse mode shows that a quasi-out-of-plane atomic displacement undergoes a significant directional change across T$_N$. Its quasi-in-plane wave vector is derived by the comparison between the measured sound velocity and the first-principles calculations. The other transverse mode is an interlayer shear acoustic mode whose amplitude is strongly enhanced in the antiferromagnetic phase, exhibiting eight times stronger amplitude than the longitudinal acoustic mode below T$_N$. The atomically resolved characterization of acoustic phonon dynamics that couple with magnetic ordering opens opportunities for harnessing unique magnetoelastic coupling in vdW magnets on ultrafast timescales.

Abstract: Crystal stacking offers a powerful yet underexplored route to engineer symmetry in layered superconductors. Here we report superconductivity in rhombohedral-stacked NbSe2 (3R-NbSe2), a non-centrosymmetric polytype in which global inversion symmetry is removed by stacking alone. Using comprehensive structural, transport, magnetic, and thermodynamic measurements, we establish superconductivity as a bulk property of the 3R phase and find that the in-plane upper critical field exceeds the Pauli paramagnetic limit, indicating the persistence of strong Ising-type spin-orbit coupling. Unlike the thickness-dependent superconductivity in centrosymmetric 2H-NbSe2, the superconducting transition temperature in 3R-NbSe2 shows little dependence on layer number but exhibits an unusually strong sensitivity to disorder. We further observe strongly enhanced nonlinear optical and electrical responses near the superconducting transition, consistent with stacking-induced inversion-symmetry breaking. Our results identify 3R-NbSe2 as a single-phase platform in which stacking engineering reshapes superconductivity and enables nonlinear transport phenomena in layered materials.

Abstract: Introducing superconductivity (SC) or magnetism into topological insulators (TIs) can give rise to novel quantum states and exotic physical phenomena. Here, we report a high-pressure transport study on the TI Ge2Bi2Te5 and its Mn-doped counterparts. The application of pressure induces a SC in Ge2Bi2Te5, which shows a dome-shape phase diagram with the maximum Tc of 7.6 K at 23 GPa. Doping Mn into Ge2Bi2Te5 introduces an antiferromagnetic order at ambient pressure and strongly weakens the pressure-induced SC, demonstrating that magnetism and SC compete in this material system. Present study provides a new platform for investigating the interplay among band topology, magnetism, and SC.

Abstract: We provide the superconducting density of states of the iron based superconductor LaRu2P2 (Tc= 4.1 K), measured using millikelvin Scanning Tunneling Microscopy. From the tunneling conductance, we extract a density of states which shows the opening of a s-wave single superconducting gap. The temperature dependence of the gap also follows BCS theory. Under magnetic fields, vortices present Caroli de Gennes Matricon states, although these are strongly broadened by defect scattering. From the vortex core size we obtain a superconducting coherence length of ξ = 50 nm, compatible with the value extracted from macroscopic Hc2 measurements. We discuss the comparison between s-wave LaRu2P2 and pnictide unconventional multiple gap and strongly correlated Fe based superconductors.
