Abstract: The discovery of zero-field fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) in moir\'e
materials has attracted intense interest in the interplay between topology and
correlations. Here, we demonstrate that fractionalized topological order can
emerge under realistic conditions even within a topologically trivial moir\'e
band. By projecting long-range Coulomb interactions into a trivial band of
twisted multilayer graphene, we identify a set of incompressible FCI ground
states exhibiting fractional quantized Hall conductance. Their Laughlin-like
behavior is further confirmed through the particle-cut entanglement spectrum.
We trace the origin of this phase to the strongly inhomogeneous distribution of
quantum geometry within the moir\'e Brillouin zone, which reshapes interaction
effects independently of the band topology. Extending this heuristic quantum
geometric mechanism, we demonstrate that similarly unexpected Laughlin-like
FCIs can also be stabilized in higher-Chern-number moir\'e bands under
experimentally accessible conditions. Our results establish realistic scenarios
under which many-body topological order can emerge independently of
single-particle band topology.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Rhombohedral multilayer graphene has emerged as a powerful platform for
investigating flat-band-driven correlated phenomena, yet most aspects remain
not understood. In this work, we systematically study the moire-dependent band
topology in rhombohedral hexalayer graphene. For the first time we demonstrate
that the moire twist angle plays a crucial role in the formation of the moire
Chern insulators in rhombohedral hexalayer graphene/hexagonal boron nitride
(RHG/hBN) moire superlattices. In the moire-distant regime at filling factor v
= 1, only systems with a twist angle {\theta} < 1.1{\deg} exhibit an integer
moire Chern insulator, while the fractional Chern insulator at v = 2/3 requires
smaller twist angle to be stabilized. Our theoretical modelling, which includes
quantum fluctuations and exact diagonalization results, suggests that
mean-field theory, which has been widely adopted, does not explain the
twist-angle dependence of the v = 1 phase diagram, and that correlation effects
are crucial. Moreover, we realize two distinct stacking configurations ( /Xi=0
and /Xi=1) between graphene and hBN, and find that both cases can yield a Chern
insulator at v = 1. Our experimental work upends the current mean-field
paradigm, illuminates how quantum fluctuations and moir\'e effects shape the
RHG/hBN phase diagram, and paves the way for future understanding and
engineering of topological correlated states in rhombohedral graphene moire
systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We propose a new pathway to the quantized anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) by
coupling an altermagnet to a topological crystalline insulator (TCI). The
former gaps the topological surface states of the TCI, thereby realizing the
QAHE in a robust and switchable platform with near- vanishing magnetization. We
demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by studying a slab of the TCI SnTe
coupled to an altermagnetic RuO2 layer. Our first-principles calculations
reveal that the d-wave altermagnetism in RuO2 induces a 7 meV gap to the Dirac
surface states on the (110) surface of SnTe, producing a finite anomalous Hall
effect. Our approach generalizes to broader classes of altermagnetic materials
and TCIs, thereby providing a family of topological altermagnetic
heterostructures with small or vanishing magnetization that support nontrivial
Chern numbers. Our results highlight a promising new topological platform with
great tunability and applications to spintronics.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We report low-temperature measurements of two adjacent, gate-defined
Josephson junctions (JJs) in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) at a
moir\'e filling factor near $\nu = -2$. We show that both junctions exhibit a
prominent, gate-tunable Josephson diode effect, which we explain by a
combination of large kinetic inductance and non-uniform supercurrent
distribution. Despite their proximity, the JJs display differences in their
interference patterns and different diode behavior, underscoring that
microscopic inhomogeneities such as twist angle variations shape the
non-uniform supercurrent and drive the diode behavior. As a result, the
nonreciprocal supercurrent can be tuned by gate voltage, enabling tuning of the
diode efficiency and even reversing the polarity at fixed magnetic fields. Our
findings offer potential routes for tailoring Josephson diode performance in
superconducting quantum circuits.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In recent years, the interplay between quantum magnetism and topology has
attracted growing interest, both for its fundamental importance and its
technological potential. Topological magnons, quantized spin excitations with
nontrivial band topology, hold particular promise for spintronics, offering
routes to robust, low-dissipation devices for next-generation information
processing and storage. While topological magnons in honeycomb ferromagnets
with weak next-nearest-neighbor Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMI) have
been extensively investigated, the strong-DMI regime remains largely
unexplored. In this work, we examine topological magnetic phases and
magnon-phonon hybridization in a two-dimensional magnetic system with strong
DMI. We show that strong DMI drives a transition from a ferromagnetic ground
state to a 120$^\circ$ noncollinear order. An additional Zeeman field further
induces noncoplanar spin textures, giving rise to a diverse set of topological
phases. We demonstrate that these topological phases can be directly probed
through the anomalous thermal Hall effect. Finally, we find that the spin-spin
interactions in the strong-$D$ phase enable magnon-phonon coupling that yields
hybridized topological bands, whereas such coupling vanishes in the weak-$D$
phase.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We investigate the emergence of a topological magnon phase in a
two-dimensional kagome ferromagnet with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI)
and scalar spin chirality. By incorporating a chiral interaction term
proportional to the scalar triple product chi_ijk = S_i (S_j x S_k), we examine
how the interplay between DMI and the topological orbital coupling kappa_TO
gives rise to geometric phase, nontrivial Berry curvature, and quantized Chern
numbers in the magnon bands. Using a momentum-space representation and linear
spin-wave theory, we compute the orbital texture, its vorticity, and the Berry
curvature across the Brillouin zone. We show that noncoplanar spin textures,
driven by finite DMI, form momentum-space skyrmions that act as sources of
geometric curvature. Importantly, we demonstrate that DMI alone is insufficient
to break time-reversal symmetry; only the presence of finite scalar chirality
terms allows the system to develop a nonzero Berry phase and topological
transport signatures. We further explore the effect of a global plaquette
rotation, showing that while the band structure remains invariant under this
unitary transformation, the Berry curvature and Chern number are modulated,
highlighting the geometric sensitivity of the topological response. Our results
establish a direct correspondence between the lattice geometry, chirality, and
magnon topology, providing a route toward tunable topological phases in
frustrated magnetic systems.

Abstract: Regardless of model and platform details, the critical phenomena exhibit
universal behaviors that are remarkably consistent across various experiments
and theories, resulting in a significant scientific success of condensed matter
physics. One widely known and commonly used example is the 2D quantum Hall
transition; yet, its universal exponents still somewhat conflict between
experiments, theoretical models, and numerical ansatzes. We study critical
behaviors of quasi-2D Weyl semimetal systems with a finite thickness $L_z>1$,
disorder, and external magnetic field $B_z$. By analyzing the scaling behaviors
of the localization lengths and local density of states using recursive
methods, we find that the finite thickness yields a deviation from the 2D
quantum Hall universality ($L_z=1$ case) and a crossover toward the 3D Gaussian
Unitary Ensemble ($L_z\rightarrow \infty$ limit), potentially offering another
cause of the discrepancy. Our work demonstrates the often-overlooked importance
of auxiliary degrees of freedom, such as thickness, and that 3D quantum Hall
physics is not merely a trivial finite-thickness extension of its 2D
counterpart.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The spin Hall effect in ferromagnets is of great interest in the field of
spintronics, and while the effect has been quantified in many materials, the
dependence of the spin Hall angle on the relative orientation of spin
polarization and the magnetization is less well studied. Of equal importance
for the purpose of spin-charge interconversion in ferromagnets is the spin
relaxation length, which is predicted to be highly anisotropic with respect to
magnetization. Using a modified lateral spin valve geometry with a copper
channel and permalloy spin injector, we measure the dependence of the spin Hall
angle and spin relaxation length on magnetization orientation in permalloy and
nickel, using two distinct device geometries. This allows us to disentangle the
contributions of the spin relaxation length and spin Hall angle to the measured
spin-charge interconversion voltage output. Our results indicate a large
anisotropy in both the spin relaxation length and spin Hall angle in both
permalloy and nickel, in agreement with theoretical calculations. The
quantities change in opposite directions, with the spin relaxation length
rising as the magnetization is moved parallel to the spin polarization and the
spin Hall angle falling, leading to a near total cancellation of the
spin-charge interconversion output.

Abstract: Chalcogenide-based optical phase change materials (OPCMs) exhibit a large
contrast in refractive index when reversibly switched between their stable
amorphous and crystalline states. OPCMs have rapidly gained attention due to
their versatility as nonvolatile amplitude or phase modulators in various
photonic devices. However, open challenges remain, such as achieving reliable
response and transparency spanning into the visible spectrum, a combination of
properties in which current broadband OPCMs (e.g., Ge2Sb2Se4Te1, Sb2Se3, or
Sb2S3) fall short. Discovering novel materials or engineering existing ones is,
therefore, crucial in extending the application scope of OPCMs. Here, we use
magnetron co-sputtering to study the effects of Si doping into Sb2Se3. We
employ ellipsometry, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and scanning and
transmission electron microscopy to investigate the effects of Si doping on the
optical properties and crystal structure and compare these results with those
from first principles calculations. Moreover, we study the crystallization and
melt-quenching of thin films via nano-differential scanning calorimetry
(NanoDSC). Our experiments demonstrate that 20% Si doping increases the
transparency window in both states, specifically to 800 nm (1.55 eV) in the
amorphous phase, while reducing power consumption by lowering the melting
temperature. However, this reduction comes at the cost of reducing the
refractive index contrast between states and slowing the kinetics of the phase
transition.

Abstract: Lead-free (K0.48Na0.48Li0.04)(Nb1-xTax)O3 (KNLNT-x) ceramics were synthesized
to study the effects of Li and Ta substitution on phase transition behavior,
microstructure, and ferroelectric, dielectric, and piezoelectric properties.
X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy show that compositions with x < 0.10
exhibit a single orthorhombic (Amm2) phase, while 0.10 <= x <= 0.20 show
coexistence of orthorhombic and tetragonal (Amm2 + P4mm) phases. For x > 0.20,
a single tetragonal (P4mm) phase is obtained. Microstructural analysis shows a
dense ceramic with decreasing grain size as Ta concentration increases.
Temperature-dependent dielectric studies reveal two transitions:
orthorhombic-tetragonal (TO-T) and tetragonal-cubic (TC). Both transition
temperatures decrease systematically with increasing Ta, and TO-T shifts below
room temperature for x > 0.15. The composition KNLNT-0.20 exhibits the highest
dielectric constant (Er = 556) and piezoelectric coefficient (d33 = 159 pC/N).
The enhanced piezoelectric response is attributed to a morphotropic phase
boundary rather than a shift of the polymorphic phase boundary temperature. A
composition-temperature phase diagram was constructed based on XRD, Raman, and
dielectric data.

Abstract: In recent years, rapid progress has been made in developing artificial
intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) methods for x-ray absorption
spectroscopy (XAS) analysis. Compared to traditional XAS analysis methods,
AI/ML approaches offer dramatic improvements in efficiency and help eliminate
human bias. To advance this field, we advocate an AI-driven XAS analysis
pipeline that features several inter-connected key building blocks: benchmarks,
workflows, databases, and AI/ML models. Specifically, we present two case
studies for XAS ML. In the first study, we demonstrate the importance of
reconciling the discrepancies between simulation and experiment using spectral
domain mapping (SDM). Our ML model, which is trained solely on simulated
spectra, predicts an incorrect oxidation state trend for Ti atoms in a
combinatorial zinc titanate film. After transforming the experimental spectra
into a simulation-like representation using SDM, the same model successfully
recovers the correct oxidation state trend. In the second study, we explore the
development of universal XAS ML models that are trained on the entire periodic
table, which enables them to leverage common trends across elements. Looking
ahead, we envision that an AI-driven pipeline can unlock the potential of
real-time XAS analysis to accelerate scientific discovery.

Abstract: We present a second-nearest-neighbor Modified Embedded Atom Method
(2NN--MEAM) potential for Scandium (Sc) and Aluminum-Scandium (Al--Sc) alloys
that unifies cohesive, thermodynamic, and solidification behavior within a
single transferable framework. The Sc component accurately reproduces cohesive
energy, lattice constants, defect energetics, and the experimental melting
point obtained from two-phase coexistence, demonstrating reliable description
of both hcp and liquid phases. The Al--Sc binary interaction parameters were
fitted using the L1$_2$--Al$_3$Sc reference and benchmarked against
first-principles and calorimetric data. The potential reproduces the strong
negative formation enthalpy of Al$_3$Sc (--0.45~eV~atom$^{-1}$), correct
relative stability of competing phases, and realistic elastic properties.
Mixing enthalpies of the liquid alloy agree with ideal-associated-solution and
CALPHAD models, confirming that the potential captures exothermic Al--Sc
association in the melt. Molecular-dynamics simulations of solidification
reveal the expected temperature and composition dependence of homogeneous
nucleation. Pure Al crystallizes readily, while Al--1~at.\%~Sc exhibits a
longer incubation and slower growth at the same absolute temperature due to
reduced undercooling and solute drag. Within the alloy, ordered Al$_3$Sc-type
L1$_2$ embryos appear spontaneously, with Sc atoms occupying cube-corner (B)
sites surrounded by twelve Al neighbors. Energy--volume trajectories confirm
that the potential links thermodynamics to microstructural evolution. Overall,
the developed 2NN--MEAM potential provides a quantitatively grounded basis for
modeling melting, solidification, and intermetallic ordering in Sc and Al--Sc
systems, enabling future multicomponent alloy design and large-scale nucleation
studies.

Abstract: We report microwave-assisted synthesis and physical properties of La-doped
SrCoO3-{\delta}. The Sr0.8La0.2CoO3-{\delta} synthesized via microwave heating
(MWH) exhibits superior physical properties compared to a nominally identical
composition obtained by conventional heating (CH) in an electrical furnace. The
MWH sample exhibits an enhanced ferromagnetic Curie temperature (158 K in CH
and 176 K in MWH samples) and higher saturation magnetization but smaller
coercive field and magnetoresistance at 10 K compared to the CH sample. While
the dc resistivity increases substantially below 120 K in the CH sample, it is
metallic from 350 to 10 K in the MWH sample. Further, the longitudinal
magnetostriction of the MWH sample ({\lambda}par = 247 ppm for H = 50 kOe) at
10 K is also higher than that of the CH sample ({\lambda}par = 128 ppm). The
observed enhanced properties of the MWH sample can not be attributed to grain
size and grain boundaries but are likely to arise from lesser oxygen defects
and partial oxidation of Co3+ into Co4+, however, the exact mechanism is not
fully understood at present.

Abstract: This paper reports on a systematic first-principles molecular dynamics
investigation of binary (TlO$_{0.5}$)$_{y}$-(TeO$_2$)$_{1-y}$ and ternary
$(TiO$_{2}$)$_{x}$-(TlO$_{0.5}$)$_{y}$-(TeO$_2$)_{1-x-y}$ tellurite glasses.
The obtained structural models are validated against available measured X-ray
pair distribution functions. In the binary system, increasing TlO$_{0.5}$
content induces network depolymerization through the reduction of Te
coordination number, the substitution of Te-O-Te linkages with
Te=O$^{-}$...Tl$^{+}$ units, and the proliferation of non-bridging oxygens. In
addition, rings analysis demonstrates a loss of the network connectivity via
the opening of small n-membered rings. In contrast, TiO$_2$ acts as a network
former in ternary glasses, preserving Te coordination number, and promoting a
high fraction of bridging oxygens. Ti atoms induces a network repolymerization
that manifests through the formation of smaller Ti-containing n-membered rings
thereby balancing the strong effect of Tl$_2$O modifier. Beside the structural
analysis, we also computed Raman spectra and non-linear optical properties on
the obtained large periodic models. Our results reproduce experimental trends
in Raman band shifts with composition, while nonlinear optical calculations
show that <$\chi^{(3)}$> remains stable with TlO$_{0.5}$ addition in binary
glasses, consistent with experiment. In the case of ternary systems, we find
that the inclusion of a small fraction of TiO$_2$ preserves the high optical
nonlinearity of the TeO$_2$ network while maintaining the overall network
connectivity. These results establish a predictive framework for tailoring the
atomic structure and nonlinear optical response of tellurite glasses through
the controlled interplay of modifiers nature and concentration.

Abstract: In this work, we report high-performance atomic-layer-deposited indium oxide
(In2O3) transistors with high gated-Hall mobility ({\mu}H) exceeding 100 cm2/Vs
at room temperature (RT). It is found that the deposition of top hafnium oxide
(HfO2) above the In2O3 channel significantly enhances its crystallization,
leading to an average grain size of 97.2 nm in a 4.2-nm In2O3 channel. The ALD
of In2O3 exhibits an epitaxy-like growth behavior, with its (222) planes
aligning parallel to the (111) planes of both the top and bottom HfO2
dielectrics. As a result, bottom-gate In2O3 transistors with a high {\mu}H of
100.9 cm2/Vs and a decent subthreshold swing (SS) of 94 mV/dec are achieved by
gated-Hall measurement at RT. Furthermore, the devices maintain excellent
performance at low temperatures, achieving a {\mu}H of 162.2 cm2/Vs at 100 K.
Our study reveals the critical role of dielectric deposition induced
crystallization in enhancing carrier transport and offers a scalable pathway
toward high-mobility devices.

Abstract: Phosphorus diffusion on a Si(100) surface was studied using scanning
tunneling microscopy (STM) at temperatures of 77 and 300 K. The phosphorus
source utilized was the PBr$_3$ molecule, which fully dissociates on the
surface at 77 K. We observed diffusion of P atoms both along and across the
rows of Si dimers. To support the observation of different diffusion pathways
of phosphorus, activation energy calculations were performed using density
functional theory. At 77 K, phosphorus diffusion started and (or) finished
mostly in bridge positions. At 300 K, phosphorus diffuses predominantly between
end-bridge positions, accompanied by bromine diffusion. The presence of Br near
phosphorus significantly restricts its mobility. Additionally, phosphorus was
found to diffuse to an oxygen atom that appeared on the surface as a result of
water adsorption. This diffusion occurs because the P site near the oxidized
dimer is more stable compared to that on the clean surface. The obtained
results complement the knowledge about the interaction of phosphorus with the
silicon surface, specifically the phosphorus diffusion pathways on the Si(100)
surface.

Abstract: Understanding and optimizing polysulfide adsorption and conversion processes
are critical to mitigating shuttle effects and sluggish redox kinetics in
lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs). Here, we introduce a
machine-learning-accelerated framework, Precise and Accurate Configuration
Evaluation (PACE), that integrates Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials
(MLIPs) with Density Functional Theory (DFT) to systematically explore
adsorption configurations and energetics of a series of N6-coordinated
dual-atom catalysts (DACs). Our results demonstrate that, compared with
single-atom catalysts, DACs exhibit improved LiPS adsorption and redox
conversion through cooperative metal-sulfur interactions and electronic
coupling between adjacent metal centers. Among all DACs, Fe-Ni and Fe-Pt show
optimal catalytic performance, due to their optimal adsorption energies (-1.0
to -2.3 eV), low free-energy barriers (<=0.4 eV) for the Li2S2 to Li2S
conversion, and facile Li2S decomposition barriers (<=1.0 eV). To accelerate
catalyst screening, we further developed a machine learning (ML) regression
model trained on DFT-calculated data to predict the Gibbs free energy (\Delta
G) of Li2Sn adsorption using physically interpretable descriptors. The Gradient
Boosting Regression (GBR) model yields an R^2 of 0.85 and an MAE of 0.26 eV,
enabling the rapid prediction of \Delta G for unexplored DACs.
Electronic-structure analyses reveal that the superior performance originates
from the optimal d-band alignment and S-S bond polarization induced by the
cooperative effect of dual metal centres. This dual ML-DFT framework
demonstrates a generalizable, data-driven design strategy for the rational
discovery of efficient catalysts for next-generation LSBs.

two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors is essential for advancing quantum
technologies and optoelectronics. Using scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS)
and luminescence (STML), we correlate the atomic structure and optical
fingerprints of individual defects in monolayer MoS$_2$. A bilayer of hexagonal
boron nitride (hBN) effectively decouples MoS$_2$ from the graphene substrate,
increasing its band gap and extending the defect charge state lifetime. This
enables the observation of sharp STML emission lines from MoS$_2$ excitons and
trions exhibiting nanoscale sensitivity to local potential fluctuations. We
identify the optical signatures of common point defects in MoS$_2$: sulfur
vacancies (Vac$_\text{S}^-$), oxygen substitutions (O$_\text{S}$), and
negatively charged carbon-hydrogen complexes (CH$_\text{S}^-$). While
Vac$_\text{S}^-$ and O$_\text{S}$ only suppress pristine excitonic emission,
CH$_\text{S}^-$ generate defect-bound exciton complexes ($A^-X$) about 200\,meV
below the MoS$_2$ exciton. Sub-nanometer-resolved STML maps reveal large
spectral shifts near charged defects, concurrent with the local band bending
expected for band-to-defect optical transitions. These results establish an
atomically precise correlation between structure, electronic states, and
optical response, enabling deterministic engineering of quantum emitters in 2D
materials.

Abstract: Thermally induced antiphase boundaries (APBs) in ferromagnetic, ordered
Ni-Mn-Ga single crystal exhibit complex, irregular shapes and closed loops
without any lattice plane preferences. The APBs were visualized on polished
(100) surface using magnetic force microscopy (MFM) at the same location in
parent cubic austenite and monoclinic martensite with uniaxial magnetic
anisotropy. Based on ab-initio calculation we suggest that one APB curve with
dark and light contrast consists of a pair of APB interfaces with narrow, only
one-layer thick, core with structural partial B2' order in contrast to full L21
order of bulk. Calculated magnetic contrast using magnetostatic continuum
simulations agrees well with MFM observation.

Abstract: Tungsten diselenide (WSe2) emerges as a promising thermoelectric (TE)
candidate due to its high thermopower (S), cost-effectiveness, and
environmentally friendly characteristics. However, pristine WSe2 exhibits
limited electrical conductivity (sigma), a low power factor (PF), and high
lattice thermal conductivity (k_L), which restrict its overall TE performance.
Here, we show that through co-doping of Nb for W and Te for Se in WSe2, its
power factor increases 17-fold, reaching 8.91 microW cm^-1 K^-2 at 850 K.
Simultaneously, its lattice thermal conductivity (k_L) decreases from 1.70 W
m^-1 K^-1 to 0.48 W m^-1 K^-1. Experiments and density functional theory (DFT)
analysis demonstrate that the enhancement of PF is linked to an increased
density of states, higher effective mass (md*), improved mobility (mu), and
elevated electrical conductivity (sigma) owing to the replacement of Se2- with
Te2-; while the observed 72% reduction in k_L results primarily from phonon
scattering at Te-Se and Nb-W defects. As a result, a remarkable ZT_max ~ 1 is
obtained at 850 K for the sample W0.95Nb0.05Se2-yTey with y = 0.3, which is
about a 30-fold increase compared to WSe2, proving that Nb and Te co-doping in
WSe2 can significantly boost its TE performance.

Abstract: Laccase is a natural green catalyst and utilized in pollution treatment.
Nevertheless, its practical application is constrained by limitations including
high cost, poor stability, and difficulties in recovery. Herein, with
inspiration from catalytic mechanism of natural laccase, we designed and
prepared a bimetallic metal-organic framework, namely, CoNi-MOF, using
low-temperature plasma (LTP) technology. We employed dielectric barrier
discharge (DBD) plasma to prepare CoNi-MOF, and by precisely modulating the
N2/O2 gas ratio, we could modulate the distribution concentration of oxygen
vacancies in CoNi-MOF. Experimental investigations and density functional
theory (DFT) calculations elucidated that the critical role of the oxygen
vacancies in enhancing the laccase-like activity, which promoted the activation
of molecular oxygen (O2) for generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS).
Compared to natural laccase, CoNi-MOF exhibited superior catalytic performance
in the degradation of antibiotic tetracycline (TC), along with enhanced
resistance to harsh environmental conditions, improved stability, and low
biotoxicity. Notably, aeration increased the dissolved oxygen (DO) content,
further improving the TC degradation efficiency. As such, this study not only
proposes a facile and efficient low-temperature plasma technology for
synthesizing high-performance laccase-like nanozymes but also provides a
promising and environmentally friendly strategy for the remediation of
antibiotic contamination in the environment.

Abstract: This article reports a concept of heat-induced topological modifications of
non-layered WO 3 followed by successful synthesis of oxygen-vacant more-porous
nanosheets with exposed active (002) facet. Experimental measurements and
Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations have revealed that the
photoexcited electrons are found to accumulate preferentially on (002) facet to
yield enhanced electron conduction, and consequently, strengthen the reduction
potential as active catalytic sites for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Owing to
these beneficial properties, the more-porous nanosheets of WO 3 with (002)
facet have exhibited superior performance than that of less-porous nanosheets
of WO3 with (220) facet and bulk WO3 with (205) facet. This study therefore
provides a new understanding of regulating physical, optical, and electronic
properties through intricate atomic structure modulation of WO3, and may find
widespread application in optoelectronics, sensors, and energy conversion.

Abstract: The incompleteness of single-particle basis sets has long cast a shadow over
correlated electronic-structure methods, making it highly challenging to obtain
numerically converged results. In this work, we compute the RPA correlation
energies of general molecules using the finite element method, while
ingeniously combining atomic orbital basis sets to accelerate the convergence
of total energies. We report atomization energies for 50 molecules within the
RPA framework, achieving accuracies on the order of meV per atom. The
computational strategy that integrates real-space discretization techniques
with atomic orbitals is expected to inspire the entire correlated

Abstract: Research on energy transport has advanced in recent years with the emergence
of transient microscopy techniques that allow for imaging of carriers with high
spatial and temporal resolution. In this context, transient scattering
microscopy (TScM), has emerged as an alternative to traditional techniques.
However, the sensitivity of TScM to different carriers can complicate the
interpretation of results, highlighting the need to develop models tailored to
TScM. Here, TScM is used to visualize exciton transport in bulk TMDCs. We show
that exciton populations exhibit non-Gaussian profiles by analyzing the their
excess kurtosis. Numerical simulations incorporating anomalous diffusion -such
as Auger recombination and trap states- reproduce these experimental
observations. Furthermore, by tuning the injected carrier density, we
demonstrate that the temporal signature of the kurtosis is distinct for
Auger-dominated and trap-dominated regimes. Additionally, we find that
traditional Gaussian-fitting methods can yield inconsistent results for the
extracted diffusivities. As an alternative, we implement a discrete variable
calculation which yields robust, consistent diffusivity values. Our results
establish kurtosis as a vital diagnostic parameter for identifying anomolous
diffusion and demonstrate the necessity of moving beyond Gaussian
approximations for accurate analysis of TScM data.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The precise incorporation of a phosphorus atom into a silicon surface is
essential for the fabrication of nanoelectronic devices in which the active
area is formed from single impurities. The most accurate approach employs
scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) lithography, which may be done with atomic
precision. However, the accuracy decreases when phosphorus is incorporated into
the surface because P substitutes one of two neighboring Si atoms with equal
probability. Here, the P-Si exchange mechanism was studied theoretically on a
chlorinated Si(100) surface with an asymmetric configuration of Cl vacancies
surrounding the P atom. Density functional theory was used to estimate the
activation barriers and exchange rates between a P atom and neighboring Si
atoms on a Si(100)-2$\times$1-Cl surface with three Cl vacancies. The
calculation of various P-Si exchange pathways revealed that phosphorus has a
higher probability of substituting one Si atom than the others due to the
asymmetric configuration of Cl vacancies. Based on the theoretical study of the
P-Si exchange mechanism and experimental results from previous works, a scheme
for controlled P incorporation into the silicon surface without uncertainty is
proposed.

Abstract: Dangling bonds (DBs) are common defects in silicon that affect its electronic
performance by trapping carriers at the in-gap levels. For probing the
electrical properties of individual DBs, a scanning tunneling microscope (STM)
is an effective instrument. Here we study transitions between charge states of
a single DB on chlorinated and brominated Si(100)-2$\times$1 surfaces in an
STM. We observed transitions between positively and negatively charged states
of the DB, without the participation of the neutral state. We demonstrated that
the $(+/-)$ transition occurs when the DB and substrate states are out of
equilibrium. This transition is related to the charge neutrality level (CNL),
which indicates a change in the DB's character from donor-like to
acceptor-like. The STM voltage at which the $(+/-)$ transition took place
varied depending to the electrostatic environment of the DB. Our results
complement the understanding of the electronic properties of the DBs, and they
should be taken into account in applications that use charge manipulation on
the DBs.

Abstract: Atom probe tomography (APT) provides the three-dimensional composition of
materials at near-atomic length scales, achieving detection limits in the range
of tens of atomic parts-per-million regardless of element type. APT requires
the specimen to be shaped as a needle with a tip radius of ~100 nm. The
development of site-specific lift-out procedures using focused ion
beam-scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) has enabled APT analysis of
multifunctional materials, advancing our understanding of their
structure-composition-property relationships. Yet these approaches are not
readily suitable for analyzing many nanomaterials. Co-electrodeposition of
metallic films forms a composite containing the nanomaterials of interest,
thereby facilitating APT specimen preparation and enabling analysis of
nanowires, nanosheets, and nano- and microparticles, etc. In this perspective
article, we showcase diverse examples from simple elementary to compositionally
complex alloys of varying dimensionalities, from individual nanoparticles to
aerogel structures. We emphasize the challenges encountered with specific
material classes during co-electrodeposition procedures and provide
recommendations for improving specimen preparation protocols to enhance
measurement yield, thereby advancing APT analysis capabilities for optimizing
the performance of functional nanomaterials.

physical validation across a range of hydrogen concentrations and compare our

Abstract: Ferrons are a type of quasiparticle corresponding to elementary excitations
of the ferroelectric order. Analogously to how magnons modulate and transport
magnetization, ferrons modulate and transport electric polarization. Here, we
introduce multiferrons as elementary excitations with both electric and
magnetic character. Multiferrons lead to a tilt and elliptical precession of
the polarization and at the same time create a magnetization through the
mechanism of dynamical multiferroicity. Using first-principles calculations for
LiNbO$_3$, we show that the electric polarization of multiferrons is
perpendicular to the equilibrium ferroelectric polarization, whereas the
magnetization is parallel to it. Our calculations further demonstrate that
multiferrons carry net electric and magnetic quadrupole and octupole moments,
which we term multipolons. These multipolons could couple to internal
multipolar degrees of freedom, for example in altermagnets, or to external
probes such as neutrons, leading to potentially experimentally observable
phenomena following coherent or thermal excitation of multiferrons.

Abstract: Abnormal grain growth (AGG) influences the properties of polycrystalline
materials; however, the underlying mechanisms, particularly the role of solute
segregation at the grain boundary (GB), are difficult to quantify precisely.
This study demonstrates a multiscale framework that integrates atomic-scale
segregation energetics (using density functional theory) with mesoscale grain
growth dynamics (using phase-field model) to investigate AGG, using $\alpha$-Fe
as an example system. Multisite segregation energies are calculated for
symmetric tilt grain boundaries (STGBs) along the $\langle 110 \rangle$ axis
for nine different solutes (Co, Cr, Mn, Mo, Nb, Ni, Ti, W, and V), encompassing
three different types of coincident site lattice (CSL) boundaries: $\sum 3
(11\bar{2})$, $\sum 9 (\bar{2}21)$, and $\sum 3 (\bar{1}11)$. The model takes
into account the effect of solute drag on GB mobility, estimated using a bulk
solute concentration of 0.1 at\%. The results demonstrate that AGG originates
due to GB anisotropy, the extent of which largely depends on the type of solute
atom present. Such a complex dependence necessitates using a multiscale model
to understand AGG comprehensively. In general, low-energy $\Sigma 3$ boundaries
are found to have higher mobility and show preferential growth for most of the
solutes, other than Co. The study reveals how the distribution of GB types
significantly influences AGG. When 10-30\% of the GBs are high-mobility type,
crown-like morphologies are observed, leading to AGG. These findings underscore
the critical role of GB chemistry and crystallography in governing AGG, and the
model can be generalized to provide a predictive framework for controlling
grain growth through strategic solute design in advanced alloys.

Abstract: The mechanism behind superconductivity suppression induced by Pr
substitutions in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ (YBCO) has been a mystery since
its discovery: in spite of being isovalent to Y$^{3+}$ with a small magnetic
moment, it is the only rare-earth element that has a dramatic impact on YBCO's
superconducting properties. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES) and DFT+$U$ calculations, we uncover how Pr substitution modifies the
low-energy electronic structure of YBCO. Contrary to the prevailing
Fehrenbacher-Rice (FR) and Liechtenstein-Mazin (LM) models, the low energy
electronic structure contains no signature of any $f$-electron hybridization or
new states. Yet, strong electron doping is observed primarily on the
antibonding Fermi surface. Meanwhile, we reveal major electronic structure
modifications to Cu-derived states with increasing Pr substitution: a
pronounced CuO$_2$ bilayer decoupling and an enhanced CuO chain hopping,
implying indirect electron-release pathways beyond simple 4$f$ state
ionization. Our results challenge the long-standing FR/LM mechanism and
establish Pr substituted YBCO as a potential platform for exploring
correlation-driven phenomena in coupled 1D-2D systems.

Abstract: We investigate the Josephson diode effect in an asymmetric SQUID consisting
of a sinusoidal Josephson junction formed by a Bi$_2$Te$_2$Se flake and a
superconducting Nb nanobridge with a linear and multivalued current-phase
relation (CPR). Current-voltage characteristics were measured both in the
absence (dc regime) and presence (ac regime) of external microwave irradiation.
Our dc measurements reveal only weak critical current asymmetry (i.e. weak
Josephson diode effect), while confirming the multivalued behavior of the
SQUID. At the same time, the key finding of this work is the observation of
strong Shapiro step asymmetry (concerning the dc current direction) in the ac
regime at finite magnetic flux. This peculiarity oscillates as a function of
magnetic field with the SQUID's periodicity and varies non-monotonically with
the increase in microwave power. Our theoretical model shows that the
pronounced Shapiro step asymmetry, despite the small diode effect in critical
current, arises from the interplay between the sinusoidal and multivalued CPRs
of the junctions.

Abstract: In this work, we have grown $\sim$100 nm thick pristine FeSe films by pulsed
laser deposition. The films were structurally characterized with X-ray
diffraction and their surface morphology checked through atomic force
microscopy. Microwave measurements, performed with a dielectric loaded
resonator tuned at the frequency of 8 GHz, allowed the characterization of the
samples surface resistance, in view of potential applications in microwave
haloscopes for dark matter search. Here, we report the comparison of the
microwave properties of FeSe with Fe(Se,Te) thin films, as the temperature is
swept from 4 K to 20 K. By applying a constant static magnetic field of 12 T,
it was also possible to discern the magnetic field resilience of the two
samples. FeSe showed a larger critical temperature drift as the field is
applied, while the Fe(Se,Te) response broadens remarkably less. A preliminary
analysis of vortex pinning shows margins for optimizing pinning in FeSe.

Abstract: We unveil a mechanism that enables a robust supercurrent diode effect in
Josephson junctions based on multiband superconductors. We predict that
interband pairing can significantly amplifies this effect, even under weak
spin-orbit coupling while intraband pairing alone would render it negligible.
To illustrate this, we examine monolayer FeSe/STO, a system where recent
experiments suggest interband pairing in either a nodeless $d$-wave or $\eta$
pairing state. Using experimentally derived parameters, we predict that
FeSe/STO can serve as a high-temperature platform for realizing a substantial
supercurrent diode effect, with efficiencies reaching up to $30\%$ for $d$-wave
pairing and $12\%$ for $\eta$ pairing. These results demonstrate that measuring
the supercurrent diode effect can provides a powerful probe of the pairing
symmetry in monolayer FeSe/STO, offering critical insights into its
superconducting state.
