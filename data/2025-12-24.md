Abstract: We study a vertical double quantum dot (DQD) in a Si/Si$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$/Si double-well heterostructure for full electrical control of electron Loss-DiVincenzo (LD) spin qubits, using realistic device modeling and numerical simulations. Due to the emerging spin-orbit interaction in the DQD, as well as strain from the gate electrodes, small (percentage range) but finite $g$ tensor variations emerge. In addition, we find a large valley splitting, on the order of $E_v{\sim}250\,μ$eV. As a result, multiple avenues for fast electrical single qubit rotations emerge. An ac electric field gives rise to electric dipole spin resonance (EDSR), while electron spin resonance (ESR) in the presence of an ac magnetic field can be electrically controlled by local gates due to varying $g$ factors in DQDs. We also show that shuttling between neighboring dots, in vertical and horizontal direction, results in ultrafast single qubit gates of less than a nanosecond. Remarkably, this DQD architecture completely eliminates the need for micromagnets, significantly facilitating the scalability of LD spin qubits in semiconductor foundries.

Abstract: Hybrid quantum devices using surface acoustic waves show promise as key elements of quantum information processors. We report measurements of integrated flip-chip devices consisting of semiconductor quantum dots and surface acoustic wave resonators in lithium niobate. We observed that the pyroelectric effect in lithium niobate inhibited the operation of quantum dots in the integrated devices. GaAs/AlGaAs devices suffered from unintentional carrier depletion, and Si/SiGe devices suffered from electrostatic discharge. Our results highlight the importance of mitigating pyroelectric effects in semiconductor-lithium niobate hybrid devices for continued progress in quantum interconnects and transducers.

Abstract: Superconducting resonators integrated with Ge quantum wells (QWs) offer a promising platform for hybrid quantum devices. Yet, in the most common heterostructure architectures, they have so far been limited by sizable photon losses. Here, we report the fabrication and characterization of microwave resonators patterned in the Al thin film of an in-situ grown superconductor/semiconductor hybrid heterostructure (HS). The semiconductor part of this hybrid HS is grown on a commercial Ge substrate. We consistently achieve internal quality factors $Q_i>1000$, surpassing previous results on Ge QW heterostructures grown using the concept of a virtual Ge substrate on Si substrates. We reach $Q_i \approx 49000$ at single-photon occupation and a plateau of $Q_i \approx 20000$ at sub-one photon, an order of magnitude larger than any previously reported value of resonators on Ge QW structures at low power. We further characterize the thin Al film forming the resonator, extracting its kinetic inductance and superconducting gap, and studying its magnetic field dependence. Notably, the resonance remains well-defined up to in-plane magnetic fields of 850 mT. A hysteresis emerges in the out-of-plane magnetic field dependence, for both the resonance frequency and the quality factor, indicating an interesting interplay between vortex- and quasiparticle loss mechanisms.

Abstract: We investigate the dynamic polarization of nuclear spins in a nominally undoped GaAs/Al$_{0.35}$Ga$_{0.65}$As quantum well using two complementary experimental approaches: time-resolved Kerr rotation and optical orientation measurements of photoluminescence. Using the first technique, we measure a remarkably large Overhauser field of 3.1 T in a geometry close to the Faraday configuration for a 19.7 nm wide quantum well at a temperature of 1.6 K. A nuclear spin temperature of 6.4 $μ$K is measured at an external magnetic field of 0.006 T following an adiabatic sweep from 0.6 T. Despite the quadrupole-induced nuclear spin splitting inherent to nanostructures, the nuclear spin system is found to follow the predictions of spin temperature theory. Using the optical orientation of the photoluminescence, we investigated nuclear spin dynamics at millikelvin temperatures down to 300 mK. At a temperature of 500 mK, an Overhauser field of 160 mT is generated in an oblique but nearly Voigt magnetic field using low optical power to avoid heating. The nuclear polarization build-up time is of 150 s, consistent with earlier reports at higher temperatures, where hyperfine scattering on free photoexcited electrons governs relaxation. At 500 mK, the onset of dynamic self-polarization of nuclear spins is observed, which becomes more pronounced as the lattice temperature is further reduced to 300 mK. The estimated nuclear spin temperature in the dynamic self-polarization regime can be as low as 200 nK.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation of the structural and electronic properties of Sn intercalated buffer layers on SiC(0001) using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (LT-STM/STS), spot-profile analysis low-energy electron diffraction (SPA-LEED), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Sn intercalation effectively decouples the buffer layer, yielding quasi-free-standing monolayer graphene (QFMLG) while introducing local lattice distortions. Bias-dependent STM imaging revealed the coexistence of conventional and Kekule-ordered graphene domains, governed by the underlying Sn(1x1) reconstruction at the SiC interface. The measured STS spectra exhibit good agreement with DFT results. However, achieving homogeneous Sn(1x1) domains remains challenging, apparently, due to strain within the Sn monolayer, which drives the emergence of Kekule distortions and the associated electronic band-gap opening omogeneously in graphene. These findings highlight the crucial role of intercalant homogeneity and strain in tuning graphene`s structural and electronic properties.

Abstract: Flat bands in graphitic materials emerged as a platform for realizing tunable correlated physics. As a nodal-line semimetal, rhombohedral graphite features flat drumhead surface states in the vicinity of the Dirac points, which carry a nontrivial topological charge. We present a comprehensive study on rhombohedral graphite with twist stacking faults. Using both the continuum models and the realistic tight-binding models, we show that the twist angle between the graphene layers can tune the interface states at such stacking faults. The evolution of interface states originates from the interplay between the moiré periodicity and Zak phase topology, predicting the occurrence of nearly flat bands throughout the moiré Brillouin zone. We further investigate the disorder-induced layer polarization and tunable Chern number for flat band, and characterize the relationship between the disorder strength and Chern number in twisted rhombohedral graphite.

Abstract: Moiré superlattices in van der Waals materials have revolutionized the study of electronic and excitonic systems by creating periodic electrostatic potentials. Extending this concept to magnetic materials promises new pathways in merging spintronics with photonics. While moiré magnetism has been revealed with near-field probes and nonlinear optical techniques, the coupling of these magnetic textures to optical excitations - magneto-moiré excitons - remains unexplored. Here, we report the observation of magneto-moiré excitons in twisted bilayer CrSBr, correlated with moiré spin textures that emerge below a critical twist angle of ~2°. The nanoscale moiré spin texture imprints distinct signatures onto the optical spectrum, shifting the exciton energy via a periodic magnetic exchange field. First-principles calculations corroborate that these signatures arise from one-dimensional spin textures governed by the balance of exchange interactions and domain wall energy. Our results demonstrate that moiré magnetism can be used to engineer nanoscale excitonic energy landscapes, providing a new platform for magneto-optical sensing, quantum transduction, and control of non-collinear magnetism and topology through light.

Abstract: The spin dynamics of localized electrons in bulk semiconductors is governed by the interplay of effective nuclear field fluctuations, spin exchange between electrons, and spin transitions into the conduction band. Using spin noise spectroscopy, we reveal this interplay for donor-bound electrons in a CdTe/CdMgTe quantum well and spectrally separate electron spin relaxation and dephasing in zero magnetic field. We identify a specific regime of the electron spin dynamics, where temperature-induced activation of spin-independent hopping leads to a monotonic acceleration of electron spin relaxation. This behavior contrasts with bulk CdTe crystals, where the motional narrowing effect is observed. We attribute this difference to the significantly larger inhomogeneous broadening of the donor-related trion resonance in our quantum well compared to bulk samples. The theoretical analysis of the spin noise power and the strength of the spin exchange interaction provides the estimation of the donor concentration in our unintentionally doped structure.

Abstract: Layered magnetic and strongly correlated materials present a rich platform for condensed matter physics with intrinsic properties intertwined by magnetism and low-dimensionality. A suspended light-emitting 2D antiferromagnetic membrane forms a highly controllable hybrid system in which the interplay between spin ordering, optical and mechanical degrees of freedom can be uniquely explored. NiPS$_3$ hosts excitons responsible for a puzzling luminescence down to a few atomic layers, linked to its zigzag antiferromagnetic order. The nature of these excitons remains unclear. Here we report on the magnetic excitons of a suspended few-layer NiPS$_3$ membrane. We reveal nematic zigzag states and study the optical transitions induced by the magnon-mediated motion of the excitation in the magnetic lattice, resulting in magnon-dressed excitons. We observe a strain tuning of these emission lines, dependent on their microscopic origin, with rates that sign a strong localization of the magnetic excitons, fading with the number of magnon-mediated hops.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We demonstrate that the charge value of transport mechanisms heavily impacts the validity of thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs). Specifically, we show within the framework of full counting statistics, that the recently established quantum TUR can be violated by the presence of transport processes that carry more than one charge, like Andreev reflection processes in normal metal-superconductor junctions. We propose a modified quantum TUR, which incorporates the charge value and demonstrate that this charge-dependent quantum TUR can only be violated if the highest charge transport process exceeds this charge value. In particular, we establish that the breaking of the quantum TUR solely originates from the charge value of the highest charge transport process. Namely, our analytical considerations do not invoke the existence of superconductivity, and these considerations generally hold for non-interacting electronic transport which can be described by the scattering formalism.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Transport properties of strongly correlated materials have contributions from quasiparticle excitations such as electrons and holes as well as emerging collective excitations such as sounds and plasmons which are sustained by interactions. It was previously shown in [Phys. Rev. B 106, 205127] that thermal excitation of the long-lived plasmons in graphene provides a substantial contribution to heat and momentum transport in the interaction-dominated regime. Detailed information on these excitations is therefore necessary for the understanding of hydrodynamic transport with quantitative precision. On the other hand, dynamics of graphene plasmons is usually studied using the perturbation theory within the Dirac-cone approximation, thus neglecting the effects of a finite Brillouin zone and higher-order perturbative corrections. Both these effects can be however significant for strong-interacting systems including free-standing graphene where the effective coupling constant can reach values up to two. Therefore, in this paper, we studied the behavior of plasmons in half-filled free standing graphene using unbiased Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations. We confirm the existence of well-defined resonance peaks for plasmons around the $Γ$ point, report their dispersion and the dependence of their quasiparticle residue on momentum. Comparison with the Random-phase-approximation (RPA) calculation for the Dirac theory shows that strong interactions and finite Brillouin zone effects, automatically taken into account in QMC calculations substantially alter the results. Our findings highlight the need to account for these effects analytically when developing theories of electronic transport in free-standing graphene.

Abstract: The complexity and richness of phenomena governing alloy crystal growth can be unraveled by examining the three-dimensional atomic-level distribution of elements and impurities incorporated during growth. These species act as atomic fingerprints, revealing the thermodynamic constraints that shape material structure and composition. Herein, we combine transmission electron microscopy and atom probe of tellurium (Te) inclusions within cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) single crystals. The correlative analysis uncovers nanoscale precipitates embedded within Te inclusions, consisting of CZT nanocrystals with a Zn content of 1.5 at.%. Surrounding these precipitates, an around 10 nm-thick shell is observed, enriched with copper and indium impurities. In addition, traces of sodium and sulfur are detected within the nanocrystals. These findings provide direct evidence of the complex segregation and precipitation processes occurring during CZT crystal growth, reflecting the interplay of thermodynamic driving forces and kinetic constraints that govern solute redistribution. The resulting insights contribute to a deeper understanding of impurity behavior and phase separation mechanisms in CZT alloys. This work establishes a framework for modeling and optimization of growth strategies of higher-quality CZT crystals for next-generation infrared and radiation detection technologies.

Abstract: Antiferromagnetic EuM$_{2}$Pn$_{2}$ compounds, where M is a metal element and Pn is a pnictogen element, have been recognized as candidates for realizing a topologically nontrivial electronic structure. In this paper, we focus on EuMg$_2$Bi$_2$, whose topological nature still remains unclear. We present a comprehensive study based on several experimental and theoretical techniques. Magnetic susceptibility, electrical resistivity, and specific heat capacity measurements confirm the existence of an antiferromagnetic ordering. The electronic band structure was investigated by high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), supported by ab initio calculations. ARPES measurement reveals that the electronic structure of this system is dominated by linearly dispersive hole-like bands near the Fermi level. Theoretical analyses of the electronic band structure indicates that EuMg$_2$Bi$_2$ is a strong topological insulator, which should be reflected in the presence of a metallic surface state. We also theoretically examine the magnetic-field-induced anomalous Hall conductivity, confirming previously reported observations.

Abstract: The layered van der Waals Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$ (F5GT) compound exhibits room-temperature ferromagnetism, making it a promising candidate for technological applications. In our study, combined temperature- and polarization-dependent Raman measurements, along with modern {\it ab initio} calculations, reveal important aspects of the lattice dynamics. The angle dependence of Raman intensity under linear polarization configuration exhibits a strong tilt in the laboratory coordinate, indicating the existence of anisotropic electron-phonon coupling. The electron-phonon coupling was also examined via the Fano parameter of the asymmetric peak in the Raman spectra. Finally, the threefold rotational symmetry guarantees the existence of chiral phonons. We present direct spectroscopic evidence for these chiral vibrational modes through cross-circularly polarized Raman measurements, complemented by theoretical calculations of phonon circular polarization. Together, these results identify F5GT as an ideal platform for investigating emergent couplings among lattice, electronic, and magnetic degrees of freedom and for advancing the understanding of chiral phonons in magnetic van der Waals materials.

Abstract: The hole-doped NdNiO$_2$ layer deposited on the SrTiO$_{3}$ surface exhibits unconventional superconductivity. Here, we present a systematic study of the electronic and magnetic properties of the NdNiO$_2$ superconductor using the density functional theory (DFT). The strong local Coulomb interactions in the Ni($3d)$ and Nd($4f$) states are included within the DFT+$U$ method. The effect of Sr doping on the electronic band structure and density of states was studied for the NdNiO$_2$ thin films deposited on the SrTiO$_3$ (001) surface. The results obtained for the uncapped thin films were compared with the calculations for the NdNiO$_2$ films capped by the SrTiO$_3$ layer. We have found significant changes in the electronic structure and magnetic properties of the thin films compared to the bulk crystal.

Abstract: This study is focused on the mechanism of in vitro biomineralization on the surface of CaO.MgO.2SiO2 (diopside) nanostructured coatings by scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy assessments. A homogeneous diopside coating of almost 2 um in thickness was deposited on a medical-grade stainless steel by coprecipitation, dipping and sintering sequences. After soaking the sample in a simulated body fluid (SBF) for 14 days, a layer with the thickness of 8 μm is recognized to be substituted for the primary diopside deposit, suggesting the mineralization of apatite on the surface. Investigations revealed that the newly-formed layer is predominantly composed of Ca, P and Si, albeit with a biased accumulations of P and Si towards the surface and substrate, respectively. The variations in the ionic composition and pH of the SBF due to the incubation of the sample were also correlated with the above-interpreted biomineralization. In conclusion, the multiple ion-exchange reactions related to Ca, Mg, Si and P were found to be responsible for the in vitro bioactivity of nanodiopside.

Abstract: Excellent gate electrostatics in field effect transistors (FETs) based on two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide (2D TMD) channels can dramatically decrease static power dissipation. Energy efficient FETs operate in enhancement mode with small and positive threshold voltage (Vth) for n-type devices. However, most state-of-the-art FETs based on monolayer MoS2 channel operate in depletion mode with negative Vth due to doping from the underlying dielectric substrate. In this work, we identify key properties of the semiconductor/dielectric interface (MoS2 on industrially relevant high dielectric constant (k) HfO2, ZrO2 and hBN for reference) responsible for realizing enhancement-mode operation of 2D MoS2 channel FETs. We find that hBN and ZrO2 dielectric substrates provide low defect interfaces with MoS2 that enables effective modulation of the Vth using gate metals of different work functions (WFs). We use photoluminescence (PL) and synchrotron X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements to investigate doping levels in monolayer MoS2 on different dielectrics with different WF gate metals. We complement the FET and spectroscopic measurements with capacitance-voltage analysis on dielectrics with varying thicknesses, which confirm that Vth modulation in ZrO2 devices is correlated with WF of the gate metals - in contrast with HfO2 devices that exhibit signatures of Vth pinning induced by oxide/interface defect states. Finally, we demonstrate FETs using a 2D MoS2 channel and a 6 nm of ZrO2 dielectric, achieving a subthreshold swing of 87 mV dec-1 and a threshold voltage of 0.1 V. Our results offer insights into the role of dielectric/semiconductor interface in 2D MoS2 based FETs for realizing enhancement mode FETs and highlight the potential of ZrO2 as a scalable high-k dielectric.

Abstract: The emergence of altermagnets has driven groundbreaking advances in spintronics. Notably, d-wave altermagnets support non-relativistic spin transport, efficient charge-to-spin conversion, and T-odd spin currents. In addition, their integration as electrodes in antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions (AFMTJs) enables a tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect, allowing electrical detection of Néel vectors for next-generation memory devices. In this work, we investigate the non-relativistic spin transport properties of the quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) d-wave altermagnet KV\textsubscript{2}Se\textsubscript{2}O and the TMR effect in KV\textsubscript{2}Se\textsubscript{2}O-based AFMTJs via first-principles calculations. Our results reveal that KV\textsubscript{2}Se\textsubscript{2}O exhibits a non-relativistic longitudinal spin polarization and a spin Hall angle both exceeding 60\% at room temperature, while KV\textsubscript{2}Se\textsubscript{2}O-based AFMTJs achieve a giant TMR reaching approximately $10^{12}$\%, which remains robust against Fermi level shifts. These findings highlight the anisotropic spin polarization inherent to d-wave staggered magnetism and underscore the critical role of Fermi surface topology in enhancing T-odd spin transport and the TMR effect in AFMTJs.

Abstract: Electromagnetic response is commonly computed in two languages: length-gauge molecular polarizabilities and velocity-gauge (Kubo) conductivities for periodic solids. We introduce a compact, gauge-invariant bridge that carries the same microscopic inputs-transition dipoles and interaction kernels-from molecules to crystals and heterogeneous media, with explicit SI prefactors and fine-structure scaling via $(α_{\rm fs})$. The long-wavelength limit is handled through a reduced dielectric matrix that retains local-field mixing, interfaces and 2D layers are treated with sheet boundary conditions (rather than naïve ultrathin films), and length-velocity equivalence is enforced in practice by including the equal-time (diamagnetic/contact) term alongside the paramagnetic current. Finite temperature is addressed on the Matsubara axis with numerically stable real-axis evaluation (complex polarization propagator), preserving unit consistency end-to-end.
  The framework enables predictive, unit-faithful observables from radio frequency to ultraviolet-RF/microwave heating and penetration depth, dielectric-logging contrast, interfacial optics of thin films and 2D sheets, and adsorption metrics via imaginary-axis polarizabilities. Numerical checks (gauge overlay and optical $(f)$-sum saturation) validate the implementation. Immediate priorities include compact, temperature- and salinity-aware kernels with quantified uncertainties and \emph{operando} interfacial diagnostics for integration into multiphysics digital twins.

Abstract: One focal challenge in engineering low-power and scalable all-oxide spintronic devices lies in exploring ferromagnetic oxide material with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) and electronic conductivity while exhibiting tunable spin states. Targeting this need, spinel nickel cobaltite (NiCo2O4, NCO), featured by room-temperature ferrimagnetically metallic ground state with strong PMA, emerges as a promising candidate in the field of oxide spintronics. The cation distribution disorder inherent to NCO renders competing electromagnetic states and abnormal sign reversal of anomalous Hall effect (AHE), introducing an additional freedom to adjust electromagnetic transports. Here, we unveil multi-state electromagnetic phase modulations in NCO system through controllable cation disorder and proton evolution, extensively expanding electromagnetic phase diagram. The cation disorder in NCO tunable by growth temperature is identified as a critical control parameter for kinetically adjusting the proton evolution, giving rise to intermediate hydrogenated states with chemical stability. Hydrogen incorporation reversibly drives structural transformation and electromagnetic state evolutions in NCO, with rich spin-dependent correlated physics uncovered by combining the AHE scaling relation and synchrotron-based spectroscopy. Our work not only establishes NCO as a versatile platform for discovering spin-dependent physical functionality but also extends the horizons in materials design for state-of-the-art spintronic devices harnessing magneto-ionic control and inherent cation disorder.

Abstract: A systematic study of the structural, electronic, and optical properties of cage-like boron clusters, with the number of constituent atoms ranging from 20 to 122, has been carried out within the framework of density-functional theory (DFT), employing 6-31G(d, p) extended basis set. The dynamic stability of the clusters is analyzed through the vibrational frequency analysis, while to study the thermodynamic stability, we computed their binding energies per atom. The results suggest that the 32- and 92-atom cages are the most stable among the small and the large structures. The optical absorption spectra of these cages is computed using the time-dependent densityfunctional theory (TDDFT), which suggests their applications in optoelectronic devices in the visible range of the spectrum.

Abstract: Shear band propagation and interaction are critical to the mechanical performance of metallic glasses and are strongly governed by thermal history, yet their microscopic mechanisms remain unclear. Here, using molecular dynamics simulations combined with a state-of-the-art annealing protocol, we systematically investigate these behaviors in a model metallic glass across effective quenching rates spanning six orders of magnitude. Through a double-notch model, we show that the normalized interaction distance relative to the single shear band width is significantly larger in slowly quenched samples than in rapidly quenched ones. Atomic-scale analysis reveals that rapidly quenched samples exhibit a high density of pre-existing soft regions, which trigger correlated shear transformation zones through local vortex fields, resulting in propagation path locking and weak inter-band coupling. In contrast, slowly quenched samples exhibit enhanced structural heterogeneity and a right-shifted activation energy spectrum, promoting a single large-scale vortex field ahead of the shear band front. This field facilitates long-range stress transmission and induces shear band deflection, convergence, and coalescence, a transition resembling a "shielding effect" in fracture mechanics, where vortex-mediated disturbances destabilize the advancing shear band front. Our findings establish a direct microscopic connection between glass stability and shear-band-mediated plasticity and suggest that regulating shear band interactions offers a promising route to enhance the room-temperature ductility of metallic glasses.

Abstract: Enhancing the kinetic stability of glasses often necessitates deepening thermodynamic stability, which typically compromises ductility due to increased structural rigidity. Decoupling these properties remains a critical challenge for functional applications. Here, we demonstrate that pattern engineering in metallic glasses (MGs) enables unprecedented kinetic ultrastability while retaining thermodynamic metastability and intrinsic plasticity. Through atomistic simulations guided by machine-learning interatomic potentials and replica-exchange molecular dynamics, we reveal that clustering oxygen contents, driven by reaction-diffusion-coupled pattern dynamics, act as localized pinning sites. These motifs drastically slow structural relaxation, yielding kinetic stability comparable to crystal-like ultrastable glasses while retaining an energetic as-cast state. Remarkably, the thermodynamically metastable state preserves heterogeneous atomic mobility, allowing strain delocalization under mechanical stress. By tailoring oxygen modulation via geometric patterning, we achieve an approximately 200 K increase in the onset temperature of the glass transition (Tonset) while maintaining fracture toughness akin to conventional MGs. This work establishes a paradigm of kinetic stabilization without thermodynamic compromise, offering a roadmap to additively manufacture bulk amorphous materials with combined hyperstability and plasticity.

Abstract: The rapid emergence of universal Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (uMLIPs) has transformed materials modeling. However, a comprehensive understanding of their generalization behavior across configurational space remains an open challenge. In this work, we introduce a benchmarking framework to evaluate both the equilibrium and far-from-equilibrium performance of state-of-the-art uMLIPs, including three MACE-based models, MatterSim, and PET-MAD. Our assessment utilizes Equation-of-State (EOS) tests to evaluate near-equilibrium properties, such as bulk moduli and equilibrium volumes, alongside extensive Minima Hopping (MH) structural searches to probe the global Potential Energy Surface (PES). Here, we assess universality within the fundamental limit of unary (elemental) systems, which serve as a necessary baseline for broader chemical generalization and provide a framework that can be systematically extended to multicomponent materials. We find that while most models exhibit high accuracy in reproducing equilibrium volumes for transition metals, significant performance gaps emerge in alkali and alkaline earth metal groups. Crucially, our MH results reveal a decoupling between search efficiency and structural fidelity, highlighting that smoother learned PESs do not necessarily yield more accurate energetic landscapes.

Abstract: The discovery of ordered magnetism in two-dimensional van der Waals materials at the monolayer limit challenges the Mermin-Wagner theorem, which forbids spontaneous breaking of continuous symmetries in two dimensions at finite temperatures. The persistence of static magnetism in low-dimensions is fundamentally influenced by magnetic anisotropy and the local single-ion crystalline electric field. Crucially, spin-orbit coupling connects the structural properties with spin degrees of freedom. We investigate the magnetic single-ion properties in the van der Waals magnet VI$_3$. Utilizing neutron and x-ray diffraction, we map out the symmetry breaking phase transitions and argue for a single structural transition at T$_S \sim$ 80 K, driven by an orbital degeneracy, followed by a ferromagnetic transition at a lower temperature, T$_C \sim$ 50 K. Through a comparative analysis of samples prepared under varying conditions, we suggest that lower temperature transitions reported near $\sim$ 30 K are not intrinsic to VI$_{3}$. A group theoretical analysis suggests a structural transition from rhombohedral $R\overline{3}$ to triclinic $P\overline{1}$ or $P1$. This transition is significant as it suggests the formation of two distinct crystallographyically inequivalent V$^{3+}$ sites, each with distinct spin-orbital properties. Neutron spectroscopy provides evidence for dominant magnetic exchange coupling only between symmetry-equivalent sites in the triclinc unit cell. We suggest this breaks up the low-temperature honeycomb VI$_3$ lattice into two interpenetrating approximately hexagonal planes resulting in a fragmentated honeycomb. Our findings highlight the critical role of magnetoelastic coupling in determining the magnetic and structural phases in two-dimensional van der Waals magnets.

Abstract: Lead-free tin-based halide perovskites are attractive for flexible and environmentally benign optoelectronics, but their application is limited by the rapid oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ and poor operational stability. Here, we report a flexible CsSnI3 nanowire photodetector that achieves both high near-infrared photoresponse and long-term stability through synergistic aluminium-substrate contact engineering and dipolar interface modification. A 0.2 mm anodized aluminium foil serves as the flexible substrate, where localized laser ablation exposes metallic aluminium regions that act as reductive sites, effectively suppressing Sn2+ oxidation during nanowire growth. Simultaneously, a polar interlayer of 3-fluoro-2-nitroanisole is introduced to improve energy-level alignment, suppress interfacial deprotonation, and enhance charge extraction. The resulting device exhibits a responsivity of 0.39 A W-1, a specific detectivity of 1.38 * 10^13 Jones, and a wide linear dynamic range of 156 dB under 850 nm illumination. Moreover, the device retains over 85% of its initial photocurrent after 60 days in ambient air and maintains 94% of its initial photocurrent after 1000 bending cycles. This work establishes an effective strategy for stabilizing Sn-based perovskites toward high-performance flexible optoelectronic devices.

Abstract: Magnetic and electronic transport properties of Co$_2$MnZ (Z = Al, Ga, Ge, Si, Sn) Heusler alloys were experimentally investigated. Electrical resistivity, in the temperature range from 4.2 to 300 K, as well as field dependences of the Hall effect and magnetization at T = 4.2 K in magnetic fields up to 100 kOe and 70 kOe, respectively, were measured. Experimental data are in good agreement with the results of the theoretical DFT calculations of the electronic structure and magnetic moments. In the band structure of Co$_2$MnSi, half-metallicity is formed with the full spin polarization and the half-metallic gap of about 0.6 eV. In Co$_2$MnZ (Z = Al, Ge, Sn), it is shifted from the Fermi energy by the hole pockets at the point $Γ$, preventing thereby the formation of the half-metallic state. In a peculiar case of Co$_2$MnGa, the antisite defects are expected to determine structural and electronic properties. For the Co$_2$MnAl and Co$_2$MnGa topological semimetals, Weyl topological points are found at the Fermi energy; however, for Z = Si, Ge, Si, these features are located deeper within to the valence band. The results show that Co$_2$MnGe and Co$_2$MnSn are usual ferromagnets, Co$_2$MnAl and Co$_2$MnGa alloys are topological semimetals that can find application in microelectronics, while Co$_2$MnSi is a half-metallic ferromagnet that is in high demand in spintronics.

Abstract: Hyperbolic metamaterials enable extreme light confinement and control of photonic states, but their realization has been restricted to inorganic architectures. Here, a fully organic route to fabricate artificial hyperbolic metamaterials based on multilayered thin films of J-aggregate carbocyanine dyes alternated with polyelectrolytes is introduced. These structures exhibit strong optical anisotropy and experimentally support hyperbolic surface exciton polaritons and, for selected dyes, additional surface waves in near-zero permittivity regimes. Spectroscopic ellipsometry confirms a uniaxial dielectric tensor with negative in-plane and positive out-of-plane components, close to the absorption peaks of the constituent J-aggregates. This anisotropy is preserved across individual layers, demonstrating the robustness of the layer-by-layer approach and enabling the coupling of surface exciton polaritons and near-zero permittivity modes even in films only a few nanometres thick. Transfer-matrix simulations based on the obtained dielectric tensor reproduce the coupling conditions for all thicknesses, validating the optical model. Structural characterization reveals the link between optical anisotropy and supramolecular order, with preferential in-plane molecular orientation and the evolution from discrete nanostructures to continuous films as deposition progresses. These organic hyperbolic metamaterial architectures, associated with narrow excitonic resonances from J-aggregates, offer a unique platform for tailoring emission, energy transport, and exploring polariton dynamics at the nanoscale.

Abstract: First-principles based crystal structure prediction (CSP) methods have revealed an essential tool for the discovery of new materials. However, in solids close to displacive phase transitions, which are common in ferroelectrics, thermoelectrics, charge-density wave systems, or superconducting hydrides, the ionic contribution to the free energy and lattice anharmonicity become essential, limiting the capacity of CSP techniques to determine the thermodynamical stability of competing phases. While variational methods like the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation (SSCHA) accurately account for anharmonic lattice dynamics \emph{ab initio}, their high computational cost makes them impractical for CSP. Machine-learning interatomic potentials offer accelerated sampling of the energy landscape compared to purely first-principles approaches, but their reliance on extensive training data and limited generalization restricts practical applications. Here, we propose an iterative learning framework combining evolutionary algorithms, atomic foundation models, and SSCHA to enable CSP with anharmonic lattice dynamics. Foundation models enable robust relaxations of random structures, drastically reducing required training data. Applied to the highly anharmonic H$_3$S system, our framework achieves good agreement with the benchmarks based on density functional theory, accurately predicting phase stability and vibrational properties from 50 to 200 GPa. Importantly, we find that the statistical averaging in the SSCHA reduces the error in the free energy evaluation, avoiding the need for extremely high accuracy of machine-learning potentials. This approach bridges the gap between data efficiency and predictive power, establishing a practical pathway for CSP with anharmonic lattice dynamics.

Abstract: Orbital-Free Density Functional Theory (OFDFT) has re-emerged as a viable alternative to Kohn-Sham DFT, driven by recent advances in kinetic energy density functionals (KEDFs). Nonlocal (NL) KEDFs have significantly extended OFDFT's applicability, particularly for bulk solids, but their high computational cost and dependence of system-specific parameters limit their universality. In this work, we propose a semilocal KEDF at the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) level that achieves accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art NL and meta-GGA functionals, while remaining entirely parameter-free. Our construction revives the Thomas-Fermi-von Weizsacker (TFvW) framework by modulating the relative contributions of TF and vW terms through physically motivated constraints and preserving the exact second-order gradient expansion. Despite its simple form, the proposed functional (KGE2) performs remarkably well across both extended systems (metals and semiconductors) and finite systems (clusters), without any need for parameter tuning. These results mark a step toward a transferable, computationally efficient, and general-purpose KEDF suitable for large-scale OFDFT simulations.

Abstract: Disordered superconductors in low dimensions provide an exemplary manifestation for the role of quantum fluctuations in a many-body system. Specifically in Josephson arrays with comparable Josephson and charging energies ($E_J\sim E_C$), disorder tends to change the nature of the paradigmatic Superconductor-Insulator Transition (SIT) and potentially leads to formation of multiple distinct phases. We address this problem in a model of a two-legged Josephson ladder subjected to a wide spatial distribution of its parameters along the legs. In contrast, we assume the system to have a perfect $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry to interchange between the legs, and investigate the effects of spatial randomness which preserves this symmetry in the strong-disorder limit. To this end, we apply a strong randomness real-space renormalization group technique and explore the resulting phase diagram. We identify three disorder-dominated phases, including an intermediate phase between a disordered superconductor and a disordered insulator. The latter insulating phase can be mapped to a XY spin-chain in a spin glass phase, while the intermediate phase turns out to be a Bose glass.

Abstract: The discovery of high-temperature superconductors remains a central challenge in materials science. Hydrogen-rich compounds are among the most promising candidates, as they can exhibit phonon-mediated superconductivity at elevated critical temperatures, though their stabilization typically requires extreme pressures. %
Here, we report the identification of YSbH$_{6}$ as a promising superconductor by a multi-stage high-throughput screening on ternary A15-type hydrides, followed by a high-throughput computational search of the Y--Sb--H system, accelerated by ephemeral data derived potentials. %
The cubic $Pm\Bar{3}$ YSbH$_{6}$ phase exhibits a predicted critical temperature of 118\,K at 50\,GPa, among the highest $T_{\rm c}$ reported to date for an A15-hydride at this pressure. Thermodynamic analysis shows that YSbH$_{6}$ lies $\sim$100\,meV/atom above the convex hull at 50\,GPa, but only 26\,meV/atom above the hull at 120\,GPa, suggesting possible metastability and synthesis at similar high pressure conditions. The phase is dynamically stable over a wide pressure range (20--120\,GPa), displays kinetic stability at 50\,GPa and elastic stability at 20 and 50\,GPa, key ingredients for long-lived metastable behaviour at moderate pressures. %
These results highlight YSbH$_{6}$ as a benchmark case illustrating the balance between high-$T_{\rm c}$ performance and limited thermodynamic stability in ternary hydrides, and underscore the importance of combined dynamic, thermodynamic, kinetic and elastic stability analyses for guiding experimental synthesis of metastable superconductors.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate the intrinsic (impurity-independent) spin Nernst effect (SNE), a spin current generation perpendicular to temperature gradients, in spin-triplet superconductors. We show that, in these systems, the SNE consists of two distinct contributions: a direct quasiparticle contribution and an indirect supercurrent contribution. The quasiparticle contribution originates from the momentum space Berry curvature generated by spin-triplet Cooper pairs. The indirect contribution arises from a compensating supercurrent that cancels the bulk thermoelectric charge current. While this contribution vanishes when the condensate has no spin-polarization in momentum space, it can be comparable in magnitude to the quasiparticle contribution in nonunitary superconductors. These results demonstrate that thermoelectric spin supercurrent must be explicitly accounted for when evaluating the SNE in nonunitary superconductors.

Abstract: We introduce a class of superconductors termed "quantized quadrupole superconductors" that support Majorana corner modes according to the bulk-corner correspondence, distinct from previous works on the second-order topological superconductors. An intrinsic physical quantity for superconductors, i.e., the quadrupole moment serves as the topological invariant, which is always half-quantized due to the particle-hole symmetry. As examples, two types of mixed pairings, $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}\pm id_{xy}$ and $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}\pm is$, induced in the bilayer two-dimensional electron gases with Rashba spin-orbit coupling give the quadrupole phase. Extended discussions indicate that the nontrivial phase is robust against relative phase fluctuations in the mixed pairings and the disorders. Our schemes provide realistic platforms to implement Majorana zero modes, paving the way for studying the Majorana physics.

Abstract: Near a quantum critical point (QCP) in a metal, strong Fermion-Fermion interactions mediated by soft collective bosons give rise to two competing phenomena: non-Fermi liquid behavior and superconductivity that deviates from conventional BCS and Migdal-Eliashberg theories. We consider the problem of obtaining closed-form analytical lower and upper bounds on transition temperatures for such systems. We focus mainly on a class of models known as the gamma-model, which generalizes the Eliashberg theory of Superconductivity where the effective interaction potential scales as V(Omega) ~ 1/|Omega|^gamma. Building on a recent reformulation of Migdal-Eliashberg theory, expressed as a classical infinite spin chain with nonlocal interactions, and employing a simple linear algebra framework, we derive rigorous closed-form expressions for upper and lower bounds on the superconducting transition temperature for any gamma > 0. While our lower bounds coincide precisely with those previously in the literature, our derivation offers a more streamlined and accessible method. Moreover, our upper bounds are substantially tighter than any existing estimates and converge rapidly enough to the numerical results from various prior studies.

Abstract: We propose a novel type of topological superconductivity based on Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces (BFSs) in an altermagnetic topological insulator proximitized by an s-wave superconductor. The 3D altermagnetic topological insulator is characterized by zero-energy surface states in bulk nodal-ring phases and anisotropically shifted surface Dirac cones in topological insulating phases. It is potentially realized in \mathrm{EuIn_{2}As_{2}}. The altermagnetic order in combination with superconductivity gives rise to highly anisotropic superconducting gaps with crystal-facet-dependent BFSs at the physical boundaries. These particular BFSs provide distinct platforms to realize Majorana zero modes (MZMs). We propose a quasi-1D nanowire in which the anisotropic BFSs experience topological phase transitions due to quantum confinement leading to MZMs at its ends. We further consider vortex phase transitions in the superconducting altermagnetic topological insulators. Remarkably, we find that the altermagnetic order allows us to transit between two distinct type of MZMs, one type is located at the vortex line, while the other type is located at the physical boundaries. Our work paves a new avenue utilizing altermagnetism-induced BFSs to engineer topological superconductivity through crystal anisotropy and quantum confinement.

Abstract: Recent advances have shown that introducing dependency interactions between two superconducting networks can trigger abrupt, hysteretic normal-superconductor phase transitions. In this study, we demonstrate that such behavior can also arise in a single-network superconducting system that features two distinct types of interactions: short-range electrical connectivity and long-range thermal dependency. Using experimental and simulation methods, we show that when sufficient heat is dissipated within a single-layer disordered superconducting network, the system undergoes a mixed-order phase transition marked by both a discontinuous change in resistance and critical scaling behavior. We find that the emergence and characteristics of these abrupt transitions depend critically on the thermal conductivity of the underlying substrate, establishing heat flow as the origin of the unique phase transition. Additionally, both experimental and numerical results reveal long-lived transient states and scaling dynamics near the critical point, consistent with spontaneous branching processes observed in interdependent networks theory. These findings strongly demonstrate that complex critical phenomena, such as mixed-order transitions, previously attributed to structurally interdependent systems, can also arise within single-layer physical systems when dual interactions coexist. Our results broaden the scope of the theory and experiments of phase transitions in interdependent networks and suggest new ways to design and control phase changes in physical, biological, and technological systems where two interactions are present.

Abstract: In strongly correlated superconductors, the emergence of superconductivity is often accompanied by anomalous normal state. The connection between these two phenomena is considered crucial for understanding the underlying unconventional pairing mechanisms. In this study, we report analogous behavior in MoS2, a band insulator devoid of long-range magnetic order. Through ionic liquid gating, continuous doping control from the underdoped to the overdoped regime was achieved, revealing a symmetric superconducting dome that holds characteristic scaling relations mirror the behavior of strongly correlated superconductors. Strikingly, this system exhibits pronounced non-Fermi liquid transport near optimal doping, characterized by a quasi-linear temperature dependence of resistivity over a wide range and a T2-dependent Hall angle cotangent. The strength of the non-Fermi liquid transport is positively correlated with the superconducting transition temperature, with both evolving synchronously across the phase diagram. These results highlight the potential of MoS2 as an ideal platform for studying the intrinsic connection between non-Fermi liquid transport and superconductivity.

Abstract: We present an ensemble machine-learning approach for composition-based, structure-agnostic screening of candidate superconductors among ternary hydrides under high pressure. Hydrogen-rich hydrides are known to exhibit high superconducting transition temperatures, and ternary or multinary hydrides can stabilize superconducting phases at reduced pressures through chemical compression. To systematically explore this vast compositional space, we construct an ensemble of 30 XGBoost regression models trained on a curated dataset of approximately 2000 binary and ternary hydride entries. The model ensemble is used to screen a broad set of A-B-H compositions at pressures of 100, 200, and 300 GPa, with screening outcomes evaluated statistically based on prediction consistency across ensemble members. This analysis highlights several high-scoring compositional systems, including Ca-Ti-H, Li-K-H, and Na-Mg-H, which were not explicitly included in the training dataset. In addition, feature-importance analysis indicates that elemental properties such as ionization energy and atomic radius contribute significantly to the learned composition-level trends in superconducting transition temperature. Overall, these results demonstrate the utility of ensemble-based machine learning as a primary screening tool for identifying promising regions of chemical space in superconducting hydrides.

Abstract: The influence of metallic and semiconducting (V, Al, and Si) under-layer induced charge carrier substitution on the superconducting properties of the Ti40V60 alloy thin films are studied and also compared with a pristine reference film without any under-layer. All the films exhibit metallic behavior in the normal state and a superconducting transition at low temperatures, where the superconducting transition temperature is tunable between 4.77 K and 5.73 K. Hall measurements on the films reveal that the under-layer strongly affects the charge carrier type and density, leading to a correlation between increasing carrier concentration and decreasing TC. The Si under-layer introduces the highest disorder yet yields the highest TC, indicating that in the Ti40V60 alloys, moderate disorder suppresses the spin-fluctuations induced pair breaking, thereby enhancing the superconductivity. The comparable TC of the V under-layer and pristine films without under-layer, along with a coherence length (~6.2 nm) much smaller than the film thickness (25 nm), confirms the absence of any significant proximity effects. These findings demonstrate that under-layer engineering provides an effective route to tune the superconducting properties of Ti-V alloy thin films.

Abstract: A series of experiments revealed that novel bipartite magnetic and superconducting (SC) phases widely exist in the phase diagrams of iron pnictides and chalcogenides. Nevertheless, the origin of the two-dome magnetic and SC phases in iron-based compounds remains unclear. Here we theoretically investigated the electronic structures, magnetic and SC properties of three representative iron-based systems, i.e. LaFeAsO$_{1-x}$H$_{x}$, LaFeAs$_{1-x}$P$_{x}$O and KFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$. We propose a unified quasi-degenerate orbital mechanism for the emergence of the two-dome parent magnetic/structural phase and the subsequent two-dome SC phase. It is found that the degenerate in-plane anisotropic $d_{xz/yz}$ orbitals dominate the first magnetic/structural and SC phases, while in-plane isotropic orbitals $d_{xy}$ or $d_{3z^{2}-r^{2}}$ with quasi-degeneracy originating from quasi-symmetry drive the emergence of the second magnetic/SC dome phase. Moreover, a matching rule of spin and orbital modes for SC pairing state is proposed in multi-orbital iron-based systems. These results imply an orbital-driven mechanism as well as an orbital-selective scenario, and shed light on the understanding of the multi-dome magnetic and SC phases in multi-orbital systems.

Abstract: Using ac composite magnetoelectric technique, we map the phase diagrams of EuFe(As1-xPx)2 to resolve the interplay between superconductivity and ferromagnetism. For samples with Tc<TFM, the transition to a ferromagnetic multi-domain state suppresses Hc2 through the breakdown of Jaccarino-Peter compensation and enhanced magnetic scattering from inter-domain disorder, while Hirr is reduced due to vortex-antivortex pair nucleation at domain walls disrupting the vortex lattice. Conversely, for samples with Tc>TFM, strong short-range spin correlations and phase boundaries within a multiphase coexistence regime near the triple point act as potent pair-breaking centers, leading to pronounced Hc2 suppression.

Abstract: We combine a cryogenic BiCMOS integrated circuit, which generates high-speed return-to-zero (RTZ) pulses, with a superconducting Josephson junction array. The BiCMOS circuit acts as a cryogenic pulse pattern generator, delivering data rates of 30 Gb/s, while consuming 302 mW at 4 K. Each electrical pulse of the serializer effectively transfers one magnetic flux quantum through every Josephson junction, so that the average output voltage of the array produces well-defined plateaus (Shapiro steps) in its current-to-voltage characteristic. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first integration of a Josephson junction array with a cryogenic BiCMOS chip. The presented results pave the way toward a hybrid and fully integrated Josephson arbitrary waveform synthesizer (JAWS) that can generate ultra-low-noise signals for quantum voltage metrology and quantum information systems.

Abstract: In a recent experiment [Nature 642, 58 (2025)], a new record for the superconducting critical temperature $T_c$ among infinite-layer nickelates has been reported in doped SmNiO$_2$. Here, we use the cutting-edge dynamical vertex approximation (D$Γ$A), and qualitatively as well as quantitatively reproduce the $T_c$ vs. doping dome for this compound. Encouraged by this, we go further and identify a path towards realizing even higher $T_c$'s by changing the cation along the line Nd$\rightarrow$Sm$\rightarrow$Y$\rightarrow$Lu with matching substrates. The successively smaller cation radius allows for smaller lattice constants of the substrate. This in turn increases the in-plane hopping and thus eventually $T_c$.

Abstract: Murunskite K$_2$Cu$_3$FeS$_4$ is a representative sulfosalt, isostructural to the pnictides, but with electronic properties more similar to the insulating parent compounds of the cuprates. We use it as a bridge to compare the chemical and physical roles of metal and ligand orbitals in cuprates and pnictides.
  In cuprates, ionicity, covalency, and metallicity are tightly interwoven to give rise to high-temperature superconductivity (SC). Their most remarkable property is the interaction of an ionically localized hole on the copper (Cu) with a Fermi liquid (FL) on the oxygens (O), which is critically important for understanding all key properties of these materials. The localization is due to strong correlations on the Cu $3d$ orbital. We describe a scenario in which the localized hole gives rise both to SC by Cooper scattering of O holes, and to Fermi arcs, as observed in cuprate spectroscopy, the latter by a purely kinematic projection of the static local disorder, without invoking any residual interactions between the mobile O FL carriers.
  In the pnictides, the orbitals responsible for binding and metallic conduction appear to be separate. The Fe $3d$ $e_{g}$ orbitals hybridized with the ligands set the lattice spacing. The $3d$ $t_{2g}$ orbitals overlap directly between the Fe atoms, resulting in several electronic bands appearing at the Fermi level. The ensuing Fermi liquid exhibits both charge and magnetic correlations. We argue that a similar SC scenario as in the cuprates is plausible in the pnictides, except that a light FL scatters on a slow nearly-antiferromagnetic (AF) one, rather than on localized holes as in the cuprates.

Abstract: We develop theoretical methods to predict the effects of paramagnetic impurities on the microwave response of conventional spin-singlet superconductors. Our focus is on superconducting devices and resonators with low concentrations of impurities and exchange interactions with conduction electrons. We connect the sub-gap quasiparticle spectrum generated by pair-breaking to the frequency and temperature dependence of the conductivity for superconductors operating at microwave frequencies. We report theoretical results for superconducting device performance -- dissipation, quality factor and frequency shift anomalies -- based on self-consistent calculations of the current response and penetraion of the electromagnetic field at the vacuum-superconducting interface. Key results include the prediction of a non-monotonic anomaly in the low-frequency superfluid fraction and penetration depth at very low temperatures related to the sub-gap quasiparticle spectrum. Dissipation of microwave power is predicted from intra- and inter- impurity band transitions at GHz frequencies at low temperatures, including a physical mechanism responsible for residual resistance. We predict anomalies in the resonant frequency, $f(T)$, and quality factor, $Q(T)$, of high-Q SRF cavities operating in the GHz range at low-temperatures that are sensitive to non-magnetic and paramagnetic impurity disorder.
