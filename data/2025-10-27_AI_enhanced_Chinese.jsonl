Excitation wavelength-dependent measurements reveal that the\nphotocurrent originates from the injection of chiral polarized Weyl fermions by\nchiral polarized mid-infrared photons. The optical process that generates\nunbalanced chiral polarized Weyl fermions is determined to be a third-order\nnonlinear photocurrent process. Compared with nonmagnetic Weyl semimetals, such\ncoupling is versatilely tunable in magnetic Weyl semimetals with the\nmagnetization direction and external electric field in addition to the\nchirality of light. Our results are not only directly applicable to tunable\ncircular-polarization-sensitive photodetection in the mid-infrared regime, but\nalso pave the way toward functional quantum devices that utilize the chiral\nquantum degrees of freedom of Weyl fermions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
